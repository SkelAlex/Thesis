# Context: A Gender Gap in Political Interest?

----

How do people conceptualize political interest?

- They typically associate politics with partisan politics & foreign policy
<!--
Part of my PhD thesis, which studies how role models can transmit political interest to children and the gendered aspects behind this process. In this presentation and for this paper, I am putting the accent on my chapter about the role of parents in this process

Diplomacy, wars, elections, political parties...
-->

- But they do not associate politics with health care or education
<!--
Studies have found that even when thinking about the broader state of these two systems or specific issues related to these, "less" political
-->

- Politics refers to both agency & communality
<!--
The activity through which people make, preserve and amend the general rules under which they live @heywood2019
-->

<!--
Suddenly, in this BRITISH study, big gender gaps in both directions! Women REPORT BEING more interested in health care

Potential explanation: studies show that ON AVERAGE, men tend to see political issues in a different light: self-assertion for men, cooperation for women (happy to talk more about this after the presentation)

Aggregate measure of political interest: men report being more interested, presumably because they think "partisan politics" and "foreign policy"

Aggregate measure: generally "On a scale of 0 to 10, how would you rate your interest in politics?" or something like that

(And other studies find similar gaps for political knowledge: ON AVERAGE, women know more about how the health care system works, men TYPICALLY recall politicians' names more, so this seems to bear some resemblance with reality)
-->

## Sources of the Gender Gap in Self-Reported Political Interest

Four main literatures address the question of how a gender gap in political interest can arise. Let's start with those I do not believe are at the core of the issue

Structural factors [@inglehart2003]

Genetics [@bell2009]

<!--
In studies of monozygotic vs. dizygotic twins, those with the same genes (MZ) had more similar levels of political interest

Heritability scores of 24--62%: still half of the variation in political interest comes from elsewhere

But also, any gendered component to this remains uncertain, molecular research is scant, and the actual process and genes involved remain an unlaboured area of research

(@vanditmars2023 assess heritability by sex, with estimates of 21.9--50.8% for women and 39.6--57.2% for men. Despite these differences not being statistically significant, they find that the heritability of political interest remains stable for men across age groups on average, women's political interest becomes more heritable and less a function of the shared environment in which they live as they age. They attribute this result to the fact that when they reach adulthood, "women can more easily select into environments in which they can pursue their predisposition that drives interest in politics, which is supported by our indications of larger heritability estimates for twins who moved out of the parental home")

A more robust explanation for the Canadian context: socialization
<!--
Several studies point towards socialization as a significant factor... Including many biological studies

4 main agents of socialization: parents, peers, media, schools
-->

# Parents' Role in Political Interest Transmission

----

- Significant relationship between parents' political interest and their children's political interest
<!--
[@beauregard2008; @janmaat2022; @neundorf2013; @prior2019; @shehata2019]

@prior2019 estimates moderately strong Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.3 to 0.4 for parent--child political interest scores across three countries.
-->

- Growth in parent--child political interest correlations between ages 11 and 15
<!--
Parent--child correlations then remain stronger when both parents share a similar level of political interest, when this parental political interest is stable through time, and when children move out late from their parents' place. Prior
-->

- Causal link between parents' and children's political interest
<!--
In time series, an increase in mothers' political interest is often accompanied by an increase in their children's political interest. The same goes for fathers, and for decreases rather than increases. Shehata
-->

- Main causal mechanism: parent--child political discussions
<!--
@shehata2019 find that changes in the frequency of political discussions with parents positively predict changes in adolescents' level of political interest
-->

## Gender Differences in Transmission of Self-Reported Political Interest

----

- Transmission works better for parent--child pairs of the same gender
<!--
Mothers' political interest has a stronger effect on their daughters than sons' political interest, while fathers' political interest has a stronger effect on their sons' political interest [@beauregard2008; @owen1988; @prior2019]

Daughters' political interest seems to be influenced mostly by their mothers

(it is not clear whether sons' political interest is influenced mostly by their father [@beauregard2008; @owen1988] or mother [@prior2019])
-->

- Mother--daughter correlations particularly strong
<!--
(@prior2019: mother--daughter political interest correlations are strongest (0.43), while mother--son, father--daughter and father--son correlations all sit between 0.31 and 0.34)
-->

- Mothers and fathers talk as much about politics with sons and daughters
<!--
(earlier studies found that children discuss politics more often with their fathers than mothers [@noller1985; @oswald1998])

(it seems reasonable to assume, as @hooghe2015 do, that political discussions involving the father tend to revolve mostly around partisan politics, while political discussions with mothers might center on other topics --- presumably health care, education, gender issues, and so on)
-->

# Social Learning Theory

----

- **Social learning theory**: Children learn by observing their parents, modelling their behaviour, attitudes, habits & values after them

- Social learning is easier when the role model shares the child's gender (observer--model similarity)

- Works through social pressure
<!--
(In a political home environment, children can either feel social pressure to become interested in politics to create or maintain a sense of social belonging in the family unit, be exposed to more news media content, listen to or participate in more political discussions at home, or all of these [@shehata2019])
-->

- Research questions: *When and how does political interest transmission occur? To what extent do mothers influence political interest development in their children? Do they have a greater influence on their sons or daughters? What about fathers?*

----

- *__Hypothesis 1a__: Children's interest in specific political topics is more affected by political discussions with their same-gender parent(s) than other-gender parent(s).*
<!--
Basically, I assume the effect found in other studies for political interest will be the same for any political topic: fathers have more influence on transmitting interest to their sons, and mothers to their daughters
-->

- *__Hypothesis 1b__: Children's interest in the politics of health care and education is more affected by political discussions with their mother(s) than father(s).*

- *__Hypothesis 1c__: Children's interest in law and crime, international affairs, and partisan politics is more affected by political discussions with their father(s) than mother(s).*
<!--
Why? Because adult men and women are more interested in these topics respectively
-->

- *__Hypothesis 1d__: Children's interest in specific political topics is more affected by political discussions with their mother(s) than father(s).*
<!--
1b, 1c and 1d alternatives to 1a
-->

- *__Hypothesis 1k__: Children's interest in specific political topics becomes more and more affected by political discussions with their parent(s) between ages 11 and 15, after which the parental effects stabilize.*

# Data and Methods

----

Children Political Interest Survey (CPIS): Data collected among 698 students aged 8--18 from 7 elementary & secondary schools + 1 school board's Student Senate between August 2022 & January 2023

- Schools include various urban areas of Quebec & Ontario

- 15-minute bilingual Qualtrics online survey questionnaire filled during classroom time

- Multilevel regressions, classroom fixed effects, controls for SES & personality traits

----

Measuring children's interest in different political topics: how?

- Survey questions with *concrete examples*:

  - Health care (i.e., pandemic restrictions, working conditions of nurses)

  - International affairs (i.e., diplomatic disputes between Canada and China, Ukrainian war)

  - Law and crime (i.e., police funding, sentences for violent crimes)

  - Education (i.e., university tuition, funding of public and private schools)

  - Partisan politics (i.e., federal elections, political parties)

<!--
All these topics have political implications and are as concrete as possible for children

I also ask children which parent discusses each issue the most with them
-->

(In the upper half of the table, taking into account classroom fixed effects, boys generally report being more interested in politics than girls, but the gender gap is relatively minimal, standing at 0.43 for the 11-point political interest scale (*p*<0.05). Boys' interest in international affairs and partisan politics is higher than girls' (1-point and 0.85-point difference respectively; both *p*<0.001). This seems to be in line with the results among adult respondents. However, girls' interest in law and crime is also slightly higher (0.5 point, *p*<0.05). This result is more surprising given previous literature showing the contrary. Results for the other two topics, health care and education, are almost even between the genders, and not statistically significant, despite adult women usually reporting higher levels of interest in these two topics across studies.)

However, in the lower half of the table, controlling for socio-demographic factors, all relationships between gender and interest disappear. It might be the case that girls are less interested in some of these topics by virtue of other socio-demographic characteristics, but there does not seem to be one other socio-demographic variable that reliably predicts interest in any of the topics.

<!--
Results are mixed, but seem to show that in some respects, older teenagers (ages 16--18) are more influenced by their parents' discussion of certain topics than 10--15-year-olds.

Notably, for girls, the influence of both their father and mother is only statistically significant among 16--18 year-olds, and it grows in size compared with girls aged 10--15. No such difference between age groups is found among boys. However, for boys aged 16--18, when their parent most interested in a specific topic is their father, they become more interested in that topic, while this relationship is weaker and non-significant for boys aged 10--15.

These results provide mixed evidence for Hypothesis 1k: aging makes more statistically significant relationships emerge, but the effect sizes only become somewhat wider between age groups.

Yet, among 10--15-year-olds, political interest transmission is statistically significant in any model, which could indicate that early parental socialization is more limited than what was previously thought. It could be the case that due to a more limited sample size, smaller effect sizes are present but do not reach statistical significance. This would be consistent with the finding that, for all significant parent--child interest relationships found among 16--18-year-olds, the direction of the relationship among 10--15-year-olds is the same --- but the coefficient is larger.

Moreover, again confirming Hypothesis 1a, the largest effect sizes among 16--18-year-olds are for mother--daughter and father--son transmission.
-->

# Conclusion

----

- Social learning theory mostly corroborated: there seems to be stronger transmission of interest for parents of the same gender than their child
<!--
Fathers' discussion of various political topics is related to their sons' interest in these topics, while mothers' discussion of various political topics is related to their daughters' interest in these topics Political interest therefore seems to trickle down from parents to children in gendered ways.
-->

- Mothers and fathers discuss different political topics with their children, but discuss them as much with their sons as with their daughters
<!--
Descriptive results show a clear trend: mothers are much more likely to speak about education and health care, while fathers are more likely to speak about the other three topics. These trends mirror previous literature on interest in these topics.
-->

- Topic-by-topic patterns to be further investigated
<!--
social learning theory applies well when political interest transmission is evaluated across a range of political topics --- but not necessarily for each topic measured individually.
-->

- Results by age groups: mixed results => need for larger-n studies among teenagers
<!--
seem to indicate political interest grows with time, but these results also seem to apply to girls more than to boys --- and the increase between 10--15 and 16--18-year-olds seems rather limited. Future studies conducted among a larger number of children may be able to see more clearly time trends for the growth of parent--child political interest transmission potential.
-->

- Parent--child studies needed
<!--
a longitudinal causal study would be particularly enlightening

# Definitions

## Politics

----

::: nonincremental

- Contested concept for a long time [@gallie1956]

- "The concept is extremely broad and comprises any kind of leadership in action" (@weber1919, p.&nbsp;1)

> Politics, in its broadest sense, is the activity through which people make, preserve and amend the general rules under which they live. Politics is inextricably linked to the phenomena of conflict and cooperation. On the one hand, the existence of rival opinions, different wants, competing needs, and opposing interests guarantees disagreement about the rules under which people live. On the other hand, people recognize that, in order to influence these rules or ensure their enforcement, they must work with others (@heywood2019, p.&nbsp;34).

<!--
The definition links to conflict & cooperation
-->

:::

<!--
This is the one I use

Importantly, this definition emphasizes the notions of cooperation and competition, therefore going beyond Weber's [-@weber1919] notion of leadership. More than a partisan game, politics includes actions that preserve the policy status quo as well as actions that aim at disrupting it, including contentious politics [@tilly2015] and interest groups that seek to influence the rules --- from the international level to the local level.

## Agency & Communality

----

@campbellrosie2008 shows that men's higher self-reported political interest derives from the fact that they are more *agentic*, i.e., focused on self-assertion \[or competition\], while women are more *communal*, i.e., focused on cooperation. Since the concept of *politics* is typically seen as more adversarial, it appeals more to agentic types --- mostly men --- who then develop higher political efficacy and overall self-reported political interest, a finding also shared by @schneider2016.

One vision more likely to be shared by women, the other by men

Men's higher rates of incarceration, stronger presence in the police force, and over-representation among world leaders could lead them to take more interest in these areas.
Women use health care services more often & take a larger role in care responsibilities on average
