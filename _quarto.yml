  - "\\textbf{Abstract}"
  - "\\doublespacing Socialization by family and friends is one of the main ways in which students acquire political interest. Scholars have found adult women typically report being more interested in cooperation-focused political topics such as health care and education, while adult men report being more interested in assertion-focused political topics such as law and crime, international affairs, and partisan politics. Using data collected among 698 elementary and high school students in Quebec and Ontario, I test hypotheses derived from social learning theory to assess the extent to which parents might influence the development of a gender gap in interest in these topics among children. Results suggest parents and peers play a prominent role in transmitting some forms of political interests to their children and corroborate the idea that, in some respects, there are different socialization routes for girls and boys. While fathers have a stronger influence on their sons' political interests and mothers have a stronger influence on their daughters' political interests, discussions with friends appear to be related to political interests regardless of gender congruence. \\newline Chapter 2 outlines the data and methods used in the empirical chapters of this dissertation. It also provides descriptive statistics about some of the main variables used in the data analysis, including gender, discussions with socialization agents, interest in five political topics, and socio-demographic variables. Chapter 3 studies the evolution of political interest through life, answering questions about the stability of self-reported political interest. Chapter 4 explores the role of parents in the transmission of political interest. Chapter 5 does the same for the role of peers. Finally, the conclusion provides an overall assessment of the influence of socialization agents on the development of political interest among children and teenagers, and of the extent to which socialization can explain political interest gender gaps. The goals of this dissertation are to provide a better understanding of how men and women view politics differently, to raise awareness about this discrepancy and to provide recommendations for actors who seek to encourage interest in various political topics among adult citizens and future adult citizens of both genders."
  - "\\newpage\\textbf{Acknowledgements}"
  - "I am deeply grateful to my supervisor, Chris Cochrane, for his unwavering support throughout my doctoral journey, first as a teacher, then as a doctoral supervisor, and also as chair of UTSC, where he helped me build and organize my first class as a course instructor. Chris was a great mentor and always helped me stay focused on the most essential --- not getting distracted and clarifying the takeaway of my thesis. I also thank Profs. Randy Besco and Ruth Dassonneville for their very helpful methodological and theoretical advice on my project at all stages."
  - "I had the privilege of working as a research assistant with several faculty, and more extensively with two amazing teams led by Professors Erin Tolley and Robert Schertzer. Despite the pandemic context and the need to work mostly remotely on these research projects, it was a real pleasure logging onto Zoom calls with them and a great honour to publish in two quality peer-reviewed journals."
  - "My academic path would have been different had I not met Profs. Yannick Dufresne and Lisa Birch. After co-supervising my master's thesis, Yannick placed immense trust in me across various projects, including Radar+, Quorum Project, and most notably, the Polimeter. His guidance in applying quantitative methods in research and managing team projects sparked my passion for data science. Lisa imparted invaluable lessons not only in public policy but also in conducting media interviews and managing large-scale edited book projects. Tracking the fulfillment of electoral promises became a personal passion, and I look forward to continuing my contributions to the Polimeter. It was a pleasure to work with teammates from CLESSN and CAPP."
  - "My experience at the University of Toronto would not have been the same without the friends I made in the department. Joseph, Alexandra, Jae, Andreea, Jacob, Katie, Semuhi, Justinas, and many more I cannot name here --- thank you for making me feel welcomed and for the richness of our discussions about quant methods, politics, and life more broadly. I am also thankful to Manuel, Shweta, Dimitrios, Fraser, and my other non-academic friends for keeping me grounded and connected to life beyond academia."
  - "I am very grateful to my family, who always welcomed me back home on my frequent trips to Quebec City and supported my projects. I also thank my friends from Quebec, who were always there when I needed them. The group video calls we made were a highlight of the pandemic years."
  - "Lastly, I extend my gratitude to the Fonds de recherche du Québec --- société et culture (FRQSC) and the Ontario Graduate Scholarship (OGS) for funding my doctoral research and enabling me to pursue my academic ambitions."
