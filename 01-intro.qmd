Traditional political science studies suggest that men are generally more interested in politics than women [@burns2001; @inglehart1981; @inglehart2003; @verba1997]. However, recent studies [@campbellrosie2008; @ferrin2020; @kuhn2004; @sabella2004] show that people do not think about the full range of political actions when they are asked questions about their political interest, and that men are more interested than women in certain political topics --- notably partisan politics --- but less interested in others, such as health care and education. In parallel, studies have found parents and peers play an important role in children's political socialization [@dostiegoulet2009en; @huckfeldt1995; @mayer2004; @neundorf2013], especially when they share the children's gender [@beauregard2008; @owen1988]. While structural, institutional, biological and life-cycle factors have also been linked to the development of political interest, childhood socialization is one of its most important determinants [@jennings1981] --- and political interest remains stable from an early age [@prior2010; @prior2019]. However, parental transmission of political interest has only been studied using the traditional one-item measure of political interest, while the gendered aspects of peer transmission of political interest have not been formalized. This dissertation wishes to address both issues by suggesting a unified theory: *children's interest in specific political topics mainly comes from socialization by their same-gender parent(s) and peers*. Notably, it is argued that interest in *partisan* politics is distinctly transmitted by men and to boys.

Among various topics, interest in partisan politics is important because it is correlated with greater political ambition, which leads to men's higher levels of elite representation [@fox2005]. Since policies often have different effects on men and women, which can be influenced by policymakers' gender [@chattopadhyay2004; @donato2008; @rayment2020], the fact that women are under-represented in the legislative and executive spheres has practical consequences for the kinds of legislation adopted. By studying the origins of gender differences in political interest, potential solutions can be sought by relevant actors who seek assemblies that are more gender-balanced. Moreover, political interest has also been linked with other forms of political participation [@cicognani2012]. It is therefore possible that interest in various political topics increases the range of political actions in which men and women take part.

## Conceptual Definitions

Before digging deeper into concepts such as political interest and political ambition, it is important to define what is understood by *politics*. Politics is a contested concept [@gallie1956]. It has been defined in multiple ways by various authors. For @weber1919, "[t]he concept is extremely broad and comprises any kind of leadership in action" (p.&nbsp;1). A more recent and comprehensive definition is provided by @heywood2019 (p.&nbsp;34): "Politics, in its broadest sense, is the activity through which people make, preserve and amend the general rules under which they live. Politics is inextricably linked to the phenomena of conflict and cooperation. On the one hand, the existence of rival opinions, different wants, competing needs and opposing interests guarantees disagreement about the rules under which people live. On the other hand, people recognize that, in order to influence these rules or ensure their enforcement, they must work with others." Other sources have variously described politics as the art of government, as public affairs in general, as the non-violent resolution of disputes, or as power and the distribution of resources [@heywood2019].

In this dissertation, for the sake of clarity, *politics* is defined according to Heywood's main definition. Politics is therefore not necessarily related with the notion of leadership, and it is more than a partisan game. It includes actions that preserve the policy status quo as well as actions which aim at disrupting it, including contentious politics and interest groups which seek to influence the rules --- from the international level to the local level.

Throughout this dissertation, the umbrella term *political engagement* is used to describe forms of commitment to politics through attitudes and actions --- leaving aside the ideological content of these attitudes and actions. Political engagement has been used to refer to political interest, political discussion, political knowledge, voter turnout, political efficacy, and/or party membership [@coffe2010; @gidengil2010; @verba1997]. More narrowly, *political participation* is used to refer to political actions, such as boycotting, participating in protests, donating money to candidates, intending to vote, voting, or working with interest groups or voluntary associations which seek to influence policy at any level --- international, national, provincial, local, school board, and so on. *Political interest*, or being aware of politics and caring about it, is this study's main variable of interest. Unless otherwise specified, it refers to self-reported interest in politics in general --- and studies show that women and men tend to think about partisan politics more specifically when they answer survey questions on political interest [@campbellrosie2008; @ferrin2020]. This measure therefore has a bias towards *partisan politics*, which is defined as interest in political parties --- their leaders, inner workings and the competition between parties that happens in political institutions and on the campaign trail --- as opposed to policies and society issues themselves. Only when studies explicitly measure interest in partisan politics, this dissertation uses *interest in partisan politics* instead of *political interest*. *Political ambition* refers to ambition to run for political office [@fox2005]. Unless otherwise specified, when *political discussion* and *political efficacy* are mentioned in this dissertation, they also refer to concepts which are likely tilted towards partisan politics.

*Gender* is understood here as "sets of socially constructed meanings of masculinities and femininities, derived from context-specific identifications of sex, that is, male and female, men and women" [@beckwith2010, p.&nbsp;160]. While gender is viewed as a social construct, it is already observable at a young age and further develops through time due to biological factors --- not environmental ones [@hatemi2012]. Various other gender identities have been identified, including transgender, non-binary, gender-queer and gender-ambiguous people [@matsuno2017]. According to the 2021 Canadian Census, people who identify as transgender or non-binary made up 0.33% of all Canadians [@cbc2022]. Due to concerns with sample size and theoretical grounding, in this dissertation, only people who identify as men, women, boys and girls are studied, as in most studies of gender differences in political engagement. Further research using purposely selected samples of people who do not identify as men or women will be needed to get a better understanding of the determinants of their political interest.

While this dissertation focuses on the gender gap in self-reported political interest, different groups of women also differ on political interest. In the Dominican Republic, @spierings2012 finds that Protestant women report levels of political interest similar to men and higher than Catholic women, while Mestizo women report lower levels of political interest than Indigenous women.

## Diagnosis: Gender Differences in Political Interest and Engagement

In Canada and other Western countries, differences in political engagement are complex and often subject to disagreement between studies. On some aspects of political engagement, it is hard to tell whether men or women are more engaged. They seem to be about as likely to vote in national elections [@kostelka2019], to participate in demonstrations and political rallies [@coffe2010], to donate money to political candidates (conflicting evidence from @coffe2010 and @tolleybescosevi2022), to express high levels of political trust (conflicting evidence from @dassonneville2012 and @schoon2011), to win elections when they run for office [@golder2017; @sevi2019], and to express interest in local politics [@coffe2013; @hayes1993].^[Controlling for some of the other political attitudes mentioned here, women become *more* interested in local politics [@coffe2013] and *more* likely to vote in national elections [@coffe2010] than men, but the current focus is on raw gender differences.]

However, other aspects of political engagement point in the direction of men being more politically engaged. Studies have found that they are more likely to be interested in politics in general, including national and international politics [@verba1997]; to discuss politics [@beauvais2020; @rosenthal2003]; to have an opinion on political issues [@atkesonrapoport2003]; to try to convince other people to vote for a candidate [@beauregard2014]; to feel a sense of political efficacy, both internal and external^[*Internal efficacy*: an individual's "self-perception that they are capable of understanding politics and competent enough to participate in political acts such as voting." *External efficacy*: an individual's "perception of being able to have an impact on politics." [@gidengil2008, p.&nbsp;538]] [@gidengil2008; @verba1997]; to give correct answers to knowledge questions on political institutions [@dolan2011; @ferrin2018; @fraile2014; @norris2004; @stolle2010; @verba1997]; to vote in second-order elections^[Second-order elections include European elections, municipal elections, and most types of other sub-regional elections.] [@dassonneville2021; @kostelka2019]; to be active political party members [@coffe2010; @stolle2011]; to be politically ambitious; and to run for political office [@fox2004; @fox2005; @lawless2010; @lawless2022; @tolley2023].

Finally, research suggests women are more politically engaged on some aspects. For instance, women are more likely than men to be interested in health care, education and gender issues [@campbellrosie2008; @ferrin2020; @kuhn2004; @sabella2004], to give correct answers to knowledge questions on government services and social issues [@ferrin2018; @norris2004; @stolle2010], and to engage in private activism such as boycotting and signing petitions [@coffe2010].

Overall, the types of political engagement in which men appear to be more involved are more related to political institutions, while those in which women are more involved are more informal and --- in the case of boycotts and petitions --- anti-system. Since more power is typically concentrated in political institutions than in private activism in Canada, the aspects of politics in which men feel more engaged, such as interest in partisan and national politics, are the ones that matter the most for the daily conduct of politics in the country. The overall influence of women in Canadian politics is therefore limited.

## Consequences from the Point of View of Democratic Theory

Many aspects of political engagement are correlated and influence each other [@bennett1989; @coffe2010; @coffe2013; @ondercin2011]. This means that a gender gap in one aspect of political engagement can contribute to a gap in another aspect. More importantly, when gender differences in *partisan political interest* emerge, they can have consequences for at least two types of substantive citizen participation: discussing partisan politics with other people and running for elected political office.

### Political Discussion

Studies report men are more likely than women to discuss politics, but men and women tend to think about *partisan politics* more specifically when they think about politics [@campbellrosie2008; @ferrin2020]. Still, per @heywood2019's definition, partisan politics is only one way in which people make and change the rules that govern them. Traditional political discussion survey questions therefore mostly measure discussion of partisan politics, which is one aspect of politics on which men typically report more interest. As people usually discuss the topics they are most interested in, it seems likely that women discuss more often political topics for which they report more interest, such as health care or gender issues, although survey questions typically do not ask what kinds of political questions people discuss the most. Political discussion of various topics is seen as something desirable in participatory democracy,^[The long-standing concept of participatory democracy is also well accepted among feminist and intersectional theorists [@collins2017; @phillips1992].] since partisan politics is only the means through which relevant issues are addressed.

Discussing with people with different ideas and views also creates a phenomenon of collective intelligence [@landemore2013], which is seen as a desirable outcome from a democratic point of view, since it has been found both to reduce political polarization and to produce better reasoning, i.e., a better capacity at finding and evaluating arguments in deliberative context [@mercier2012]. It therefore seems relevant to identify the socialization elements that lead to more diversity in political discussions --- and men and women have different life experiences but also, often, different ideological viewpoints [@gidengil2005].

### Running for Elected Political Office

Studies find men have more political ambition than women. For instance, there are twice as many men than women who seek to be nominated as candidates in Canadian elections [@tolley2023]. This might be due to the fact that women "are more than twice as likely as men to consider themselves 'not at all qualified' to run for office (29% of women, compared to 14% of men) [and] are roughly 22% less likely than men to report parental encouragement" [@fox2005, p.&nbsp;654]. Political interest, self-perceived qualifications, and family socialization all predict political ambition --- i.e., having previously considered the possibility of running for office. Gender differences in partisan political interest and political efficacy, while not the only causes,^[Studies have also found that highly visible politicians are covered more negatively by the media [@fernandezgarcia2016], are more likely to be the targets of uncivil tweets [@rheault2019] and have a lower income than men --- even in Canada [@thomas2013]. These factors could also help to explain women's lower political ambition and representation.] might therefore help to explain why women are under-represented in legislative assemblies in the vast majority of countries [@ipu2023]. In Canada too, political issues are most often settled by assemblies and executives where men are the majority. At the time of writing, while the Canadian federal cabinet is gender-balanced, nine out of ten provincial premiers and most of their ministers are men. Ten years earlier, @tolley2011 also found that women represented less than 25% of Canadian legislators at the federal, provincial and municipal levels, and only 15% of mayors.

Women's lower level of political ambition is not the only factor contributing to their legislative under-representation. Discrimination against women by gatekeepers [@ashe2012] and by parties who make them candidates in hopeless ridings [@thomasbodet2013] might explain part of the gender gap in legislative representation in the country, among other factors. Still, women are not discriminated against at the polls by Canadian voters [@sevi2019] and are *more* likely than men to win elections at the municipal level when they run [@lucas2021]. An international study also finds voters discriminate against *men* candidates by 2 percentage points [@schwarz2022]. Moreover, Canadian elites discriminate against men when it comes to providing advice to political aspirants [@dhima2022].

## Potential Explanations: The Emergence of Gender Differences

This dissertation answers the following question: *"How do gender differences in interest in different political topics emerge?"* This section reviews the main theories that have been suggested to account for women's lower overall levels of self-reported political interest. This includes structural, institutional, and individual factors. The conclusion is that no convincing unified theory has been proposed thus far to account for the emergence of this gap.

### Structural Factors

#### Women's Political Under-Representation

Women politicians' relative absence in politics might explain part of the gender gap in political interest. @mayer2004 and @bos2022 find that adolescent boys and girls in the United States, Mexico, Japan, and China all think politics is a men's domain, and girls are more likely than boys to report so. Adolescent boys also report higher political interest. These two findings might be due to the fact that citizens in these four countries, like almost all countries in the world, are represented by a majority of men legislators [@ipu2023]. @buhlmann2012's study of 33 European countries finds political interest is higher among men than women in all countries, but this gap is smaller in those with higher proportions of women in their countrywide legislative assembly. They suggest the relationship is not simply an artifact of reverse causality since it holds just as well in countries with gender quotas as those without gender quotas.^[There is thus a feedback loop: political interest leads to political ambition, which leads to political representation, which in turn leads to political interest for the group with a higher level of representation.] Still, predicted probabilities show that women would be significantly less interested in politics even in a country whose parliament has reached gender parity.

#### Society Values and Culture

Broad cultural differences between countries and through time also explain some of the aggregate variation in gender differences in political interest. @inglehart1981 shows that women are more interested in politics in traditionally Protestant countries than in traditionally Catholic countries. More recently, @inglehart2003 further suggest that modernization has a positive effect on cultural attitudes towards gender equality: as societies move from agrarian to industrial and from industrial to postindustrial, people, especially younger generations, become more open to gender equality, though history, religion and institutions also play a role in shaping countries' trajectory. @dassonneville2021 also demonstrate that cultural gender differences --- operationalized through differences in boys and girls' math scores --- explain countries' gender gap in political interest. Still, these cross-country variations do not explain why significant gender gaps in political interest remain in countries where gender norms are more egalitarian or where women's rights are stronger.

### Institutional Factors

#### Political Institutions

Electoral systems could also have an influence on gender differences in political interest. @kittilson2010 find that proportional election systems --- but not federalism and parliamentary systems --- reduce gender gaps in political interest and political discussion compared with plurality systems. However, this distinction does not address the root cause of the gender gap in political interest.

### Individual Factors

#### Life-cycle events

Some individual factors that might contribute to gender differences in political interest focus on adults and life-cycle events.

##### Motherhood

First, parenthood might have a negative impact on political interest, especially for women. In a British study, @campbellrosie2008 find that being a mother has a negative effect on political interest similar in size to being a father. However, women are more likely than men to report lacking time to keep up with politics due to family time pressures. Moreover, studies in the United States, Denmark and Finland have found that the birth of a first child has a negative effect on political discussion and political participation which is stronger for women than men, especially in the short-run, since housework duties and child-rearing are disproportionately handled by women [@bhatti2019; @gidengil2008]. These findings might also translate to political interest. Nevertheless, while earlier Canadian studies also found that childbirth was negatively related with political participation [@kay1987], more recent Canadian studies do not find a link between childbirth, political discussion and political participation [@gidengil2008; @oneill2017].

##### Employment

Second, labour force participation could have a different impact on political interest for women compared with men, as was commonly hypothesized when women started to enter the labour force [@bashevkin1993]. @schlozman1999 explains the rationale like this: "exposure on the job to a broader array of people and issues would heighten engagement with politics [including political interest], especially among [United States] women" (p.&nbsp;44). However, both @schlozman1999 and @jennings1981 fail to find strong effects of labour force participation on the gender gap in political interest in the United States.

#### Biology

##### Genetics

The impact of biology, and more specifically genetics, on political interest has been confirmed by recent studies on twins. @klemmensen2012 find that political interest and political efficacy are heritable and come from the same underlying genetic factor, but it remains unclear whether this underlying factor is more present among men, women or none of them. The heritability of political interest, i.e. the proportion of the variability in political interest due to genetic differences among a population, varies in important ways from one study to the other and one national context to the other. It has been estimated that heritability stands at 24% [@weinschenk2017, United States], 36% [@weinschenk2017, Minnesota], 40% [@arceneaux2012, United States], 43% [@klemmensen2012, United States], 50% [@dawes2014, Sweden and @weinschenk2019, Germany], 57% [@klemmensen2012, Denmark], and 62% [@bell2009, Canada and the United States].

These studies emphasize that genetic differences, when they are found, add to but do not replace differences in political socialization. While estimates vary between samples, the implication of these numbers is that 38 to 76% of the variability in political interest within these populations likely comes from environmental factors. A recent study also finds that "family socialization can compensate for (genetic) individual differences and foster increased political engagement," including political interest [@rasmussen2021, p.&nbsp;1].

#### Socialization

While life-cycle events do not seem to have an effect on gender differences in political interest, some individual factors instead focus on socialization and, as biological studies themselves admit, find promising results. @hooghe2022 defines political socialization as "the process where individual actors acquire political attitudes as a result of outside influences from their direct environment" (p.&nbsp;99).

##### Partisan political interest and interest in other political topics

First, women might simply be interested in those aspects of politics that are not viewed as "typical" politics. Studies have suggested the typically reported gender gap in political interest might be the result of inadequate measurement [@alozie2003; @bourque1974]. While @alozie2003 decide to use a broader concept of "political orientation" including discussion, attention and participation in various activities, recent studies have found a creative way of addressing the limitations of the traditional measure of political interest without relying on a measure as broad as the one used by @alozie2003. On average, women report more interest in topics such as health care, education and gender issues, while men report more interest in foreign policy, partisan politics, and law and order, and topics such as taxes and local politics seem to be equally interesting to men and women [@campbellrosie2008; @coffe2013; @ferrin2020; @hayes1993; @kuhn2004; @sabella2004; @verba1997]. These studies generally conclude that men and women are simply interested in different domains of politics and that politics is mentally associated with elections and parties, topics in which men have more interest.^[This mental association might be culture-specific to some degree. Conceptions of politics cannot be based on partisan politics in other situations such as Northwest Territories' and Nunavut's non-partisan legislative assemblies, but also in authoritarian one-party regimes.] This therefore leads women to report lower levels of political interest overall.

##### Gender and personality traits

Second, gender might affect some personality traits that are relevant for the development and types of political interest. @rancer1985 show that biological sex does not predict argumentativeness, while gender identity does, with masculine individuals more argumentative than feminine individuals. They measure gender identity using a scale of *expressive* (feminine) and *instrumental* (masculine) behaviours. In a literature review, @infante1996 similarly find that men are more likely than women to value arguing and engage in it, except for workplace-related arguing. Women MPs have also been found to be less likely to resort to adversarial language in the United Kingdom [@shaw2002]. These differences seem to be politically relevant, since a recent British study by @campbellrosie2008 shows that men's higher *partisan political interest* derives from the fact that they are more *agentic*, i.e., focused on self-assertion, while women are more *communal*, i.e., focused on cooperation. Since the concept of *politics* is typically seen as more adversarial, it appeals more to agentic types --- mostly men --- who then develop higher political efficacy and overall self-reported political interest. Some studies have also shown that men are more likely to engage in verbal aggressiveness during debates, while women tend to believe that arguing is hostile and combative. Beliefs about gender differences in agency and communality also lead people to think men are better than women in negotiating, something that is then internalized by women which behave according to gender-based expectations, according to a United States study and a literature review [@kray2001; @schneider2017].

## Alternative Explanations: Towards a Unified Socialization Theory of Gender Differences in Political Interest

Overall, structural, institutional, life-cycle and biological factors provide a partial explanation of the gender gap in political interest, but socialization seems to be an especially fruitful avenue. Interest in *partisan politics* stemming from men being more assertive and less communal than women seems to explain the endurance of gender differences in interest in various political topics through life. The findings of @rancer1985 suggest agency and communality develop as a result of socialization, but two other theories rooted in *political* socialization could also be mobilized to explain the relationship between gender and political interest: *gender homophily theory* and *parental socialization theory*. Both theories point to a broad influence of same-gender role models in socialization.

### Gender Homophily Theory

*Homophily* is "the principle that a contact between similar people occurs at a higher rate than among dissimilar people" [@mcpherson2001, p.&nbsp;416]. *Gender homophily* refers to the ways in which children of the same gender tend to stick together and become friends, from at least the beginning of primary school [@stehle2013]. Children are even more likely to drop friends who have a friend from the other gender than to add the other-gender friend to their own group of friends [@mcpherson2001]. These patterns increase during primary school but diminish --- without disappearing --- after puberty [@shrum1988; @stehle2013].

Studies about gender homophily in social networking websites among teenagers and adults have yielded more nuanced results. @thelwall2009 finds that MySpace users have similar levels of interactions regardless of their gender. However, @laniado2016 find strong gender homophily among adolescent girls and boys --- though not always for the same kinds of online activities --- on a Spanish social networking service.

### Parental Socialization Theory

*Parental socialization theory* suggests that parents transmit political interest to their children and that this process is gendered, as political interest is more strongly correlated between mothers^[This dissertation uses the words "mother" and "father" without implying that there is exactly one mother and one father per family. Other situations are very common.] and daughters and between fathers and boys than any other combination [@beauregard2008; @neundorf2013; @owen1988].

## Transmission of Political Interest through Childhood Socialization

Children's political interest has been found to be influenced by four main agents of socialization: parents, peers, media, and schools. Before making formal hypotheses about their gendered effects, this dissertation assesses their role in transmitting political interest to children.

The idea that gender differences in political interest are rooted in early childhood socialization has been argued by many for a long time [@bashevkin1993; @fraile2017]. @mayer2004 find that political interest is slightly higher for boys than girls in grades 7--9 in China, Mexico and the United States, but not in Japan. @bos2022 find that *girls* are slightly more interested in politics at 6--7 years old, but then *boys* become more interested, and the gap grows larger until early adolescence.

Moreover, international and longitudinal studies find that political interest remains remarkably stable through life, including for high-school students, whose political interest is already high [@fraile2020; @neundorf2013; @prior2010; @prior2019]. Still, studies suggest that political interest becomes stronger from adolescence through early adult life [@neundorf2013], and even more so for men [@jennings1981, p.&nbsp;276]. Political socialization keeps happening at the adult age --- but it does so at a lower rate than among children and teenagers, which are therefore at the center of this dissertation. It seems worthwhile to study political socialization in the period of life where political interest is developed to better understand gender differences, since there seems to be some level of path dependency in individuals' political interest afterwards.

### Parents

<!--Parents' role in transmitting political interest to their children has been emphasized by numerous studies. @campbell1960 already suggested that "interest in politics, like partisanship, is readily transmitted within the family from generation to generation" (p.&nbsp;413). Political interest can be transmitted in parent--child political discussions [@dostiegoulet2009en; @mayer2004; @shehata2019], and parents' political interest is linked to their children's political interest according to @neundorf2013 and @shehata2019, although @jennings2009 find no statistically significant relationship for that aspect.

Research has found that the trickle-down effect of political interest from parents to children works in gendered ways. Mothers' political interest has a stronger effect on their daughters than sons' political interest, while fathers' political interest has a stronger effect on their sons' political interest. From the other perspective too, daughters' political interest seems to be influenced mostly by their mothers' political interest, while sons' political interest seems to be influenced mostly by their father's political interest [@beauregard2008; @owen1988].

@gidengil2010 and @cicognani2012 also find that a mother's level of political participation has a positive link with her daughter's political interest, while @beauregard2008 finds that parents' education has a positive influence on their children's political interest regardless of parents' gender.

Studies have investigated the gender patterns in parent--child political discussions, but the amount of political discussions does not seem to vary based on parents and children's gender. While earlier studies found that children discuss politics more often with their fathers than mothers [@noller1985], more recent research has found no significant difference between fathers and mothers [@hooghe2015; @mayer2004; @shulman2014]. Similarly, while @noller1985 found that parents discuss politics more often with their sons, @mayer2004 find they discuss it as much with their daughters as their sons.-->

### Peers

Friends and acquaintances can contribute to the development of political interest, mainly through political discussions. Political discussions with friends and acquaintances increase political interest among child and adult respondents [@klofstad2007; @shehata2019]. Peer-group diversity can also contribute to the development of political interest. The size of one's social network has been found to have a positive relationship with political interest, while political disagreement is not related to it [@pattie2009].

Political discussions among peers typically exhibit gender effects. Among adults, leaving aside relatives, 84% of men report discussing politics only with men, while 64% of women report discussing politics only with women [@huckfeldt1995]. This could be a by-product of gender homophily, since people generally spend more time with other people of the same gender.

### Media

Research has been done on the influence of political news on the development of political interest among adolescents. Although political interest can influence news media consumption, studies have shown the relationship also works in the other direction: watching more political news on traditional media and on social media has a positive effect on political interest [@holt2013; @shehata2019].

Websites can also have a positive influence on people's political interest, although this literature might be somewhat old. @lupia2005 find young adults can gain political interest by visiting informative websites under certain conditions.

Studies mostly find boys use the Internet more frequently than girls. @willoughby2008 finds that boys use the Internet just as frequently as girls in early high school, but girls' Internet use decreases in late high school, notably due to a decline in gaming, making older teenage boys more active on the Internet than girls. @tsai2010 also find boys use the Internet more than girls in junior high school, but purpose-wise, girls use the Internet for communication while boys use it more for Web exploration.

Online political engagement is more prevalent among boys than girls according to @cicognani2012, but @livingstone2005 find that girls visit more political and civic websites.

### Schools

Schools can influence childhood socialization in many ways, including citizenship education classes, classroom political discussions, extracurricular activities and active learning strategies.

While earlier studies found only weak links between citizenship education classes and political interest [@langton1968], more recent studies find a positive link [@dassonneville2012; @maheo2019; @neundorf2016]. *Citizenship education* and *civic education* classes include classes teaching facts about government and politics but also promoting political engagement [@althof2006; @themistokleous2016].

Extracurricular and active learning activities can have an effect on youth political interest. The quantity of class group projects and membership in school council are positively related to political interest, but not participation in voluntary associations nor parliamentary visits [@dassonneville2012].

Classroom political discussions in general can also increase students' political interest. For instance, students' perceptions of an *open classroom climate* marginally increases their political interest [@dassonneville2012]. An *open classroom climate* is one in which "students experience the discussion of social and political issues while in class and [in which] they feel comfortable contributing their own opinions during such discussions" [@campbell2007, p.&nbsp;62].

The role of classroom political discussions in political socialization might be gendered. For instance, @mahony1985 finds that girls are less likely to participate in classroom discussions of politics because boys make the classroom climate aggressive. However, @rosenthal2003 show that, while girls' presence has a slight positive impact on girls' speaking time, interruptions occur as frequently between adolescents whatever their gender, and studies find that 8th- to 12th-grade girls are *more* likely than boys to report an open classroom climate [@blankenship1990; @campbell2007; @maurissen2018].^[Among adults, @karpowitz2014 and @beauvais2020 also show that women and men's relative speaking time in a deliberative and decision-making setting depends on the number of women. When decisions are made by a majority, the presence of more women leads to more speaking time for each woman.]

### Summary

Overall, studies generally find parents, peers, media and schools play an important role in the transmission of political interest. Mothers and fathers, despite speaking to their children about politics as much regardless of gender, have different influences on them that also vary based on children's gender. However, studies have not tested whether peers, teachers or media personalities also have a stronger influence on political interest when they share the child's gender. For peers, gender homophily theory provides a strong reason to believe this would also be the case. Also, most of these findings imply definitions of politics that implicitly emphasize partisan politics over other aspects, but without formally hinting at it. Deconstructing by topic parents and peers' influence on political interest therefore seems relevant.

## Hypotheses

This dissertation asks *"How do gender differences in interest in different political topics emerge?"* It hypothesizes that political socialization plays a central role in explaining the emergence of gender differences in political interest, with parents and peers the most important agents of childhood political socialization.

While gender tendencies towards agency vs. communality contribute to women's interest in health care and men's interest in partisan politics,^[These processes might be reinforced by societal expectations about men and women's roles, although this explanation is more structural than socialization-driven.] a broader application of socialization theory that includes parents and peers would provide a more comprehensive understanding of who influences girls and boys in how much interest they have in varied aspects of politics. Gender homophily and parental socialization both suggest that children are influenced by same-gender models, but these theories need to be further specified. Parental socialization predicts a parent's political interest influences political interest more strongly for their same-gender children than other-gender children, but it is not clear if this applies to interest in political topics other than partisan politics. On the other hand, gender homophily predicts more same-gender than mixed-gender peer discussions, and this finding applies to political discussions as well. However, no study has thus far examined the implications of this theory for gender differences in political interest.

The study seeks to bridge two literatures on gender, socialization and political interest; one emphasizes agency/communality leading to interest in different political topics, and the other suggests the transmission of political interest by same-gender models. The goal is to measure interest in various political topics and link it to parents' and peers' interest in those same topics. This is something that has not been done before; parents' and children's political interest is typically compared using a single measure of political interest, but we do not know if same-gender models have the same impact on interest transmission for each political topic.

_**Hypothesis 1**: Children's interest in specific political topics is more affected by political discussions with their same-gender parent(s) than other-gender parent(s)._

_**Hypothesis 2**: Children's interest in specific political topics is more affected by political discussions with their same-gender peers than other-gender peers._

According to Hypothesis 1, on average, a mother will have more transmission potential of her interest in specific political topics to her daughters than sons through political discussion, for example. This reinforces gender gaps in interest in individual political topics. Hypothesis 2 uses the same logic for same-gender peers. Hypotheses 1 and 2 are summarized in @fig-hypotheses, with a few additional background details. Put neatly, the general theory is that *children's interest in specific political topics comes mainly from socialization by their same-gender parent and peers*.

Research conducted so far has spent little time analyzing the gendered effects of citizenship education programs. Studies generally find positive effects of such programs on political interest [@dassonneville2012; @maheo2019; @neundorf2016], but whether the effects are different for boys and girls is unknown. Another underlying question is left unanswered: can citizenship education programs increase all kinds of political interest, or only interest in some political topics? Does the answer to that question largely depend on program characteristics?

_**Hypothesis 3**: Citizenship education programs increase political interest more strongly for girls than boys across all political topics._
