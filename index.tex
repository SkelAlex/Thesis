\chapter{Introduction: Theories and Explanations for the Gender Gap in
Political Interest}\label{sec-chap1}}

Traditional political science studies suggest that men are generally
more interested in politics than women (Burns, Schlozman, and Verba
2001; M. L. Inglehart 1981; R. Inglehart and Norris 2003; Verba, Burns,
and Schlozman 1997). However, several recent studies (R. Campbell and
Winters 2008; Ferrin et al. 2020; Ferrı́n and Garcı́a-Albacete 2023;
Keeling 2023; Kuhn 2004; Sabella 2004a; Tormos and Verge 2022) show that
people do not think about the full range of political actions when they
are asked questions about their political interest and that men are more
interested than women in certain political topics --- notably partisan
politics --- but less interested in others --- like health care and
education politics. In parallel, studies have found parents and peers
play an important role in children's political socialization
(Dostie-Goulet 2009b; Huckfeldt and Sprague 1995; Mayer and Schmidt
2004; Neundorf, Smets, and Garcia-Albacete 2013), especially when they
share the children's gender (Beauregard 2008; Owen and Dennis 1988).
Already at age 6, boys and girls are more likely to draw male than
female politicians when asked to draw a politician (Bos et al. 2022),
suggesting aspects of gendered political socialization happen at a young
age. While structural, institutional, biological, and life-cycle factors
have also been linked to the development of political interest,
childhood socialization is one of its most important determinants
(Jennings and Niemi 1981) --- and political interest remains stable from
an early age (Prior 2010, 2019). However, parental transmission of
political interest has only been studied using the traditional one-item
measure of political interest, while the gendered aspects of peer
transmission of political interest have not been formalized. This
dissertation answers the following questions: \emph{``How do men and
women differ with regards to political interest, and why?''} In response
to these questions, I contend that, as they grow up, most boys develop
more interest in competitive aspects of politics while most girls
develop more interest in cooperative aspects of politics. I further
suggest that these segregated interests mainly emerge as a result of
gendered socialization by their same-gender parent(s) and peers.
Notably, interest in \emph{partisan} politics is distinctly transmitted
from men to boys. Therefore, I argue that gender differences are more
about the type of political interest rather than the level of political
interest.

Among various topics, interest in partisan politics has important
implications for the exercise of citizenship rights. This topic is the
most closely related to Canadian political institutions. Therefore,
interest in partisan politics may be related to greater political
ambition, which leads to men's higher levels of elite representation
(Fox and Lawless 2005). Since policies often have different effects on
men and women, which can be influenced by policymakers' gender
(Chattopadhyay and Duflo 2004; Donato et al. 2008; Rayment 2020), the
fact that women are under-represented in the legislative and executive
spheres has practical consequences for the kinds of legislation adopted.
By studying the origins of gender differences in political interest,
potential solutions can be sought by relevant actors who seek assemblies
that are more gender-balanced. Moreover, political interest has also
been linked with other forms of political participation (Cicognani et
al. 2012). It is therefore possible that interest in various political
topics increases the range of political actions in which men and women
take part.

\hypertarget{conceptual-definitions}{%
\section{Conceptual Definitions}\label{conceptual-definitions}}

Before defining relevant concepts such as political engagement,
political participation and political interest, it is important to first
define what \emph{politics} is. Politics is a contested concept and has
been for a long time (Gallie 1956). For Weber (1919), ``{[}t{]}he
concept is extremely broad and comprises any kind of leadership in
action'' (1). Heywood (2019) offers a more recent and comprehensive
definition:

\begin{quote}
Politics, in its broadest sense, is the activity through which people
make, preserve and amend the general rules under which they live.
Politics is inextricably linked to the phenomena of conflict and
cooperation. On the one hand, the existence of rival opinions, different
wants, competing needs, and opposing interests guarantees disagreement
about the rules under which people live. On the other hand, people
recognize that, in order to influence these rules or ensure their
enforcement, they must work with others (34).
\end{quote}

Other sources have variously described politics as the art of
government, as public affairs in general, as the non-violent resolution
of disputes, as power and the distribution of resources, or as the
conflictual discussion of controversial topics (Conover, Searing, and
Crewe 2002; Fitzgerald 2013; Heywood 2019; Lane 1962; Sapiro 2013; Walsh
2004).

In this dissertation, for the sake of clarity, \emph{politics} is
defined using Heywood's (2019) definition. Importantly, this definition
emphasizes the notions of cooperation and competition, therefore going
beyond Weber's (1919) notion of leadership. More than a partisan game,
politics includes actions that preserve the policy status quo as well as
actions that aim at disrupting it, including contentious politics (Tilly
and Tarrow 2015) and interest groups that seek to influence the rules
--- from the international level to the local level.

The umbrella term \emph{political engagement} is used throughout this
dissertation to describe forms of commitment to politics through either
\emph{attitudes}, \emph{actions}, or both --- leaving aside the
ideological content of these attitudes and actions. Political engagement
has been used to refer to political interest, political discussion,
political knowledge, voter turnout, political efficacy, and/or party
membership (Coffé and Bolzendahl 2010; Gidengil, O'Neill, and Young
2010; Verba, Burns, and Schlozman 1997). More narrowly, \emph{political
participation} is used to refer to political actions, such as
boycotting, participating in protests, donating money to candidates,
voting, or working with interest groups or voluntary associations that
seek to influence policy at any level --- international, national,
provincial, local, school board, and so on.

\emph{Political interest}, this study's main variable of interest, is
defined as ``the degree to which politics arouses a citizen's
curiosity'' (J. W. Van Deth 1990, 278). It therefore involves both being
aware of politics and caring about it. It is a form of political
engagement through attitudes rather than actions. When used in this
dissertation, the concept is meant to refer to people's self-reported
interest in politics in general. However, studies show that women and
men do not think of politics the same way scholars do, and instead
emphasize partisan politics more specifically when answering survey
questions on political interest (R. Campbell and Winters 2008; Ferrin et
al. 2020; Ferrı́n and Garcı́a-Albacete 2023).\footnote{Women are more
  likely to view gender issues as political than men, but otherwise men
  and women seem to define what counts as political in similar ways
  (Ferrin et al. 2020; Fitzgerald 2013).} The measure of political
interest therefore differs from the theoretical definition of politics
used for this dissertation, as it is biased towards partisan politics.
For similar reasons, when \emph{political discussion} and
\emph{political efficacy} are mentioned in this dissertation, they also
refer to concepts that are likely tilted toward partisan politics.

\emph{Interest in partisan politics} is defined as interest in the
competition between political parties that happens in political
institutions and in election campaigns --- as opposed to interest in
policies, society issues or contentious politics. When studies
explicitly measure interest in partisan politics, this dissertation uses
the expression \emph{interest in partisan politics} rather than
\emph{political interest}.

\emph{Political ambition} refers to the desire to run for political
office at any level (Fox and Lawless 2005). Political ambition is
another attitudinal component of political engagement. This desire can
be short-term or long-term.

Finally, the concept of \emph{gender} is defined here as ``sets of
socially constructed meanings of masculinities and femininities, derived
from context-specific identifications of sex, that is, male and female,
men and women'' (Beckwith 2010, 160). While gender is a social
construct, it is already observable at a young age and further develops
through time due to biological factors --- not environmental ones
(Hatemi et al. 2012). Other than men and women, various other gender
identities have been identified, including transgender, non-binary,
gender-queer, and gender-ambiguous people (Matsuno and Budge 2017).
According to the 2021 Canadian Census, people who identify as
transgender or non-binary made up 0.33\% of all Canadians (R. Easton
2022). Due to concerns with sample size and theoretical grounding, in
this dissertation, only people who identify as men, women, boys, and
girls are studied, as in most studies of gender differences in political
engagement. Further research using purposely selected samples of people
who do not identify as men or women will be needed to get a better
understanding of the determinants of their political interest.

\hypertarget{diagnosis-gender-differences-in-political-interest-and-engagement}{%
\section{Diagnosis: Gender Differences in Political Interest and
Engagement}\label{diagnosis-gender-differences-in-political-interest-and-engagement}}

In Canada and other Western countries, differences in political
engagement are complex and often subject to disagreement between
studies. On some aspects of political engagement, it is hard to tell
whether men or women are more engaged. They seem to be about as likely
to vote in national elections (Kostelka, Blais, and Gidengil 2019),
participate in demonstrations and political rallies (Coffé and
Bolzendahl 2010), donate money to political candidates (conflicting
evidence from Coffé and Bolzendahl (2010) and Tolley, Besco, and Sevi
(2022)), express high levels of political trust (conflicting evidence
from Dassonneville et al. (2012) and Schoon and Cheng (2011)), win
elections when they run for office (Golder et al. 2017; Sevi,
Arel-Bundock, and Blais 2019), and express interest in local politics
(Coffé 2013; Hayes and Bean 1993).\footnote{Controlling for some of the
  other political attitudes mentioned here, women become \emph{more}
  interested in local politics (Coffé 2013) and \emph{more} likely to
  vote in national elections (Coffé and Bolzendahl 2010) than men, but
  the current focus is on raw gender differences.}

However, other aspects of political engagement point in the direction of
men being more politically engaged. Studies have found that they are
more likely to be interested in politics in general, including national
and international politics (Verba, Burns, and Schlozman 1997); to
discuss politics (Beauvais 2020; Rosenthal, Jones, and Rosenthal 2003);
to have an opinion on political issues (Atkeson and Rapoport 2003); to
try to convince other people to vote for a candidate (Beauregard 2014);
to feel a sense of political efficacy, both internal and
external\footnote{\emph{Internal efficacy}: an individual's
  ``self-perception that they are capable of understanding politics and
  competent enough to participate in political acts such as voting.''
  \emph{External efficacy}: an individual's ``perception of being able
  to have an impact on politics'' (Gidengil, Giles, and Thomas 2008,
  538).} (Gidengil, Giles, and Thomas 2008; Verba, Burns, and Schlozman
1997); to give correct answers to knowledge questions on political
institutions (Dolan 2011; Ferrin, Fraile, and García-Albacete 2018;
Fraile 2014; Norris, Lovenduski, and Campbell 2004; Stolle and Gidengil
2010; Verba, Burns, and Schlozman 1997); to vote in second-order
elections\footnote{Second-order elections include European elections,
  municipal elections, and most types of other sub-regional elections.}
(Dassonneville and Kostelka 2021; Kostelka, Blais, and Gidengil 2019);
to be active political party members (Coffé and Bolzendahl 2010; Stolle
and Hooghe 2011); to be politically ambitious; and to run for political
office (Devroe et al. 2023; Fox and Lawless 2004, 2005, 2023; Lawless
and Fox 2010; Tolley 2023).

Finally, research suggests women are more politically engaged in some
aspects. For instance, women are more likely than men to be interested
in health care, education and gender issues (R. Campbell and Winters
2008; Ferrin et al. 2020; Kuhn 2004; Sabella 2004a; Tormos and Verge
2022), give correct answers to knowledge questions on government
services and social issues (Ferrin, Fraile, and García-Albacete 2018;
Keeling 2023; Norris, Lovenduski, and Campbell 2004; Stolle and Gidengil
2010), and engage in private activism such as boycotting and signing
petitions (Coffé and Bolzendahl 2010).

Overall, the types of political engagement in which men appear to be
more involved are more related to political institutions, while those in
which women are more involved are more informal and --- in the case of
boycotts and petitions --- anti-system. Since more power is typically
concentrated in political institutions than in private activism in
Canada, the aspects of politics in which men feel more engaged, such as
interest in partisan and national politics, concern the highest levels
of power in the country. The overall influence of women in Canadian
politics is therefore limited.

\hypertarget{consequences-from-the-point-of-view-of-democratic-theory}{%
\section{Consequences from the Point of View of Democratic
Theory}\label{consequences-from-the-point-of-view-of-democratic-theory}}

Different aspects of political engagement are correlated and influence
each other (Bennett and Bennett 1989; Coffé and Bolzendahl 2010; Coffé
2013; Ondercin and Jones-White 2011). This means that a gender gap in
one aspect of political engagement can contribute to a gap in another
aspect. More importantly, when gender differences in \emph{partisan
political interest} emerge at a young age, they can have consequences
for at least two types of substantive citizen participation when
children become adults: discussing partisan politics with other people
and running for elected political office.

\hypertarget{political-discussion}{%
\subsection{Political Discussion}\label{political-discussion}}

Studies report men are more likely than women to discuss politics, but
men and women tend to think about \emph{partisan politics} more
specifically when they think about the concept of politics (R. Campbell
and Winters 2008; Ferrin et al. 2020). Still, Heywood's (2019)
definition of politics goes beyond partisan competition and elections,
including all the ways through which people make and change the rules
that govern them. Traditional political discussion survey questions
therefore mostly measure discussion of partisan politics, which is one
aspect of politics on which men typically report more interest. As
people usually discuss the topics they are most interested in, it seems
likely that women discuss more often political topics for which they
report more interest, such as health care or gender issues, although
survey questions typically do not ask what kinds of political questions
people discuss the most. Political discussion of various topics is seen
as something desirable in participatory democracy,\footnote{The
  long-standing concept of participatory democracy is also well accepted
  among feminist and intersectional theorists (Collins 2017; Phillips
  1992).} since partisan politics is only a means through which relevant
issues are often addressed.

Discussing with people with different ideas and views also creates a
phenomenon of collective intelligence (Landemore 2013), which is seen as
a desirable outcome from a democratic point of view, since it has been
found both to reduce political polarization and to produce better
reasoning, i.e., a better capacity at finding and evaluating arguments
in deliberative context (Mercier and Landemore 2012). Therefore, it
seems relevant to identify the socialization elements that lead to more
diversity in political discussions --- and men and women have different
life experiences but also, often, different ideological viewpoints
(Gidengil et al. 2005).

\hypertarget{running-for-elected-political-office}{%
\subsection{Running for Elected Political
Office}\label{running-for-elected-political-office}}

Studies have repeatedly found that men have more political ambition than
women. For instance, there are twice as many men as women who seek to be
nominated as candidates in Canadian elections (Tolley 2023). This might
be because, in other contexts, women ``are more than twice as likely as
men to consider themselves `not at all qualified' to run for office
(29\% of women, compared to 14\% of men) {[}and{]} are roughly 22\% less
likely than men to report parental encouragement'' (Fox and Lawless
2005, 654). These two factors still stand in a 2021 follow-up study (Fox
and Lawless 2023). Political interest, self-perceived qualifications,
and family socialization all predict political ambition --- i.e., having
previously considered the possibility of running for office. Gender
differences in partisan political interest and political efficacy, while
not the only causes,\footnote{Studies have also found that highly
  visible politicians are covered more negatively by the media
  (Fernandez-Garcia 2016; Goodyear-Grant 2013), are more likely to be
  the targets of uncivil tweets (Rheault, Rayment, and Musulan 2019) and
  have a lower income than men --- even in Canada (Thomas 2013).
  Furthermore, when primed about the competitive aspects of politics,
  women's political ambition declines while men's remains stable (Preece
  and Stoddard 2015). These factors could also help to explain women's
  lower political ambition and representation.} might therefore help to
explain why women are under-represented in legislative assemblies in the
vast majority of countries (Inter-Parliamentary Union Parline 2023). In
Canada, too, political issues are most often settled by assemblies and
executives where men are the majority. In 2009, women represented less
than 25\% of Canadian legislators at the federal, provincial, and
municipal levels and only 15\% of mayors (Tolley 2011). At the time of
writing, while the Canadian federal cabinet is gender-balanced, nine out
of ten provincial premiers and most of their ministers are men.

Women's lower level of political ambition is not the only factor
contributing to their legislative under-representation, but other
factors often point in different directions. Discrimination against
women by gatekeepers (Ashe and Stewart 2012) and by parties who make
them candidates in hopeless ridings (Thomas and Bodet 2013) might
explain part of the gender gap in legislative representation in the
country, among other factors. Moreover, female candidates tend to be
more qualified than male candidates, and voters hold them to more
stringent qualification standards compared to male candidates (Bauer
2020). Still, in Canada, women receive as many votes as men on average
(Sevi, Arel-Bundock, and Blais 2019). They are also \emph{more} likely
than men to win elections at the municipal level when they run (Lucas et
al. 2021). An international study also finds female candidates get on
average 2 percentage points \emph{more} of the popular vote than male
candidates (Schwarz and Coppock 2022). Moreover, Canadian elites
discriminate against men when it comes to providing advice to political
aspirants (Dhima 2022).

\hypertarget{potential-explanations-the-emergence-of-gender-differences}{%
\section{Potential Explanations: The Emergence of Gender
Differences}\label{potential-explanations-the-emergence-of-gender-differences}}

Several theories have been suggested to account for women's lower levels
of self-reported political interest. This includes structural,
institutional, and individual factors. Yet, no convincing unified theory
has been proposed thus far to account for the emergence of this gender
gap.

\hypertarget{structural-factors}{%
\subsection{Structural Factors}\label{structural-factors}}

\hypertarget{society-values-and-culture}{%
\subsubsection{Society Values and
Culture}\label{society-values-and-culture}}

Broad cultural differences between countries and through time explain
some of the aggregate variation in gender differences in political
interest. M. L. Inglehart (1981) shows that women are more interested in
politics in traditionally Protestant countries than in traditionally
Catholic countries. More recently, R. Inglehart and Norris (2003)
further suggest that modernization has a positive effect on cultural
attitudes towards gender equality: as societies move from agrarian to
industrial and from industrial to postindustrial, people, especially
younger generations, become more open to gender equality, though
history, religion, and institutions also play a role in shaping country
trajectory. Dassonneville and Kostelka (2021) also demonstrate that
cultural gender differences --- operationalized through differences in
boys' and girls' math scores --- explain countries' gender gap in
political interest. Still, these cross-country variations do not explain
why significant gender gaps in political interest remain in countries
where gender norms are more egalitarian or where women's rights are
stronger.

\hypertarget{womens-political-under-representation}{%
\subsubsection{Women's Political
Under-Representation}\label{womens-political-under-representation}}

Women politicians' relative absence in politics might also explain part
of the gender gap in political interest. Wolbrecht and Campbell (2007)
find that adolescent girls are more likely to discuss politics with
friends in settings where there are more women legislators, while the
increase for adolescent boys is non-significant, suggesting women
politicians indeed can be role models who can increase girls' political
interest. Mayer and Schmidt (2004) and Bos et al. (2022) also find that
adolescent boys and girls in the United States, Mexico, Japan, and China
all think politics is a men's domain, and girls are more likely than
boys to report so. Adolescent boys also report higher political
interest. These two findings might be linked to the fact that citizens
in these four countries, like almost all countries in the world, are
represented by a majority of male legislators (Inter-Parliamentary Union
Parline 2023). Indeed, Bühlmann and Schädel (2012) find political
interest is higher among men than women in 33 European countries, but
this gap is smaller in countries with higher proportions of women in
their countrywide legislative assembly. They suggest the relationship is
not simply an artifact of reverse causality since it holds just as well
in countries with gender quotas as those without gender
quotas.\footnote{There is thus a feedback loop: political interest leads
  to political ambition, which leads to political representation, which
  in turn leads to political interest for the group with a higher level
  of representation.} Still, predicted probabilities show that women
would be significantly less interested in politics even in a country
whose parliament has reached gender parity.

Electoral systems could also influence gender differences in political
interest. Kittilson and Schwindt-Bayer (2010) find that proportional
election systems --- but not federalism and parliamentary systems ---
reduce gender gaps in political interest and political discussion
compared with plurality systems. Beyond this study, there have not been
any academic inquiries into the institutional determinants of the
political interest gender gap. Moreover, this distinction does not
address the root cause of the gender gap in political interest.

\subsection{Individual Factors}\label{individual-factors}}

\hypertarget{life-cycle-events}{%
\subsubsection{Life-cycle events}\label{life-cycle-events}}

Some individual factors that might contribute to gender differences in
political interest focus on adults and life-cycle events, including
motherhood and employment.

\hypertarget{motherhood}{%
\paragraph{Motherhood}\label{motherhood}}

First, parenthood might have a negative impact on political interest,
especially for women. In a British study, R. Campbell and Winters (2008)
find that being a mother has a negative effect on political interest
similar in size to being a father. However, women are more likely than
men to report lacking time to keep up with politics due to family time
pressures. Moreover, studies in the United States, Denmark, and Finland
have found that the birth of a first child has a negative effect on
political discussion and political participation which is stronger for
women than men, especially in the short run, since housework duties and
child-rearing are disproportionately handled by women (Bhatti et al.
2019; Gidengil, Giles, and Thomas 2008). These findings might also
translate to political interest. Nevertheless, while earlier Canadian
studies also found that childbirth was negatively related to political
participation (Kay et al. 1987), more recent Canadian studies do not
find a link between childbirth, political discussion, and political
participation (Gidengil, Giles, and Thomas 2008; O'Neill et al. 2017).

\hypertarget{employment}{%
\paragraph{Employment}\label{employment}}

Second, labour force participation could have a different impact on
political interest for women relative to men, as was commonly
hypothesized when women started to enter the labour force (Bashevkin
1993). Schlozman, Burns, and Verba (1999) explain the rationale like
this: ``exposure on the job to a broader array of people and issues
would heighten engagement with politics {[}including political
interest{]}, especially among {[}United States{]} women'' (44). However,
both Schlozman, Burns, and Verba (1999) and Jennings and Niemi (1981)
fail to find strong effects of labour force participation on the gender
gap in political interest in the United States.

Mestre and Marı́n (2012) also find that women work on average three more
hours of paid and unpaid work than men, and that the amount of unpaid
domestic work is negatively related to political interest for women,
suggesting women's lower political interest could stem from a lack of
time. However, the same study also finds that the amount of unpaid
domestic work is unrelated to political interest for men, which means
some other factors must be at play to explain gender differences.

\hypertarget{biology}{%
\subsubsection{Biology}\label{biology}}

\hypertarget{genetics}{%
\paragraph{Genetics}\label{genetics}}

The impact of biology, and more specifically genetics, on political
interest, has been confirmed by recent studies on twins. Klemmensen et
al. (2012) find that political interest and political efficacy are
heritable and come from the same underlying genetic factor. The
heritability of political interest, i.e.~the proportion of the
variability in political interest due to genetic differences among a
population, varies in important ways from one study to the other and one
national context to the other. It has been estimated that heritability
stands at 24\% (Weinschenk and Dawes (2017), United States), 36\%
(Weinschenk and Dawes (2017), Minnesota), 40\% (Arceneaux, Johnson, and
Maes (2012), United States), 43\% (Klemmensen et al. (2012), United
States), 48\% (Ditmars and Ksiazkiewicz (2023), Germany), 50\% (Dawes et
al. (2014), Sweden and Weinschenk et al. (2019), Germany), 57\%
(Klemmensen et al. (2012), Denmark), and 62\% (Bell, Schermer, and
Vernon (2009), Canada and the United States). Canada therefore seems to
be a country in which genetics explain a lot of the variation in
political interest.

One of these studies, Ditmars and Ksiazkiewicz (2023), assesses
heritability by sex, with estimates of 21.9--50.8\% for women and
39.6--57.2\% for men. Despite these differences not being statistically
significant, they find that the heritability of political interest
remains stable for men across age groups on average, women's political
interest becomes more heritable and less a function of the shared
environment in which they live as they age. They attribute this result
to the fact that when they reach adulthood, ``women can more easily
select into environments in which they can pursue their predisposition
that drives interest in politics, which is supported by our indications
of larger heritability estimates for twins who moved out of the parental
home'' (11).

All these studies emphasize that genetic differences, when they are
found, add to but do not replace differences in political socialization.
While estimates vary between samples, these numbers imply that 38 to
76\% of the variability in political interest within these populations
likely comes from environmental factors. A recent study also finds that
``family socialization can compensate for (genetic) individual
differences and foster increased political engagement,'' including
political interest (Rasmussen et al. 2021, 1). Genetics can also
interact with environmental factors such as socialization (Ditmars and
Ksiazkiewicz 2023).

\hypertarget{socialization}{%
\subsubsection{Socialization}\label{socialization}}

Overall, structural, institutional, life-cycle, and biological factors
provide a partial explanation of the gender gap in political interest,
but socialization seems to be an especially fruitful avenue, as
biological studies themselves admit. Hooghe (2022) defines political
socialization as ``the process where individual actors acquire political
attitudes as a result of outside influences from their direct
environment'' (99).

The idea that gender differences in political interest are rooted in
early childhood socialization has been argued by many for a long time
(Bashevkin 1993; Fraile and Gomez 2017). Mayer and Schmidt (2004) find
that political interest is slightly higher for boys than girls in grades
7--9 in China, Mexico, and the United States, but not in Japan. Bos et
al. (2022) find that girls are slightly more interested in politics at
6--7 years old, but then boys become more interested, and the gap grows
larger until early adolescence.

Moreover, international and longitudinal studies find that political
interest remains remarkably stable throughout life, including for
high-school students, whose political interest is already high (Fraile
and Sánchez-Vítores 2020; Neundorf, Smets, and Garcia-Albacete 2013;
Prior 2010, 2019). Still, studies suggest that political interest
becomes stronger from adolescence through early adult life (Neundorf,
Smets, and Garcia-Albacete 2013), and even more so for men (Jennings and
Niemi 1981, 276). Political socialization keeps happening at the adult
age --- but it does so at a lower rate than among children and
teenagers, which are therefore at the center of this dissertation.

Socialization can be carried out by multiple actors. Studies have found
children's political interest is mostly transmitted or influenced by
four agents of socialization: parents (Dostie-Goulet 2009b; Mayer and
Schmidt 2004; Neundorf, Smets, and Garcia-Albacete 2013; Shehata and
Amnå 2019), peers (Klofstad 2007; Shehata and Amnå 2019; Huckfeldt and
Sprague 1995), media (Holt et al. 2013; Lupia and Philpot 2005; Shehata
and Amnå 2019), and schools (Dassonneville et al. 2012; Mahéo 2019;
Neundorf, Niemi, and Smets 2016). These agents can also influence each
other, with Shehata and Amnå (2019) finding that political news
consumption by parents and peers can influence their own political
interest and, eventually, their children's. Transmission by parents and
peers can take the form of interactions --- notably political
discussions --- while media and schools can be agents of socialization
through the contents they produce --- notably political news or
citizenship education classes --- or the agents that bring them ---
journalists, teachers, or influencers.

The relative importance of these four agents has been studied by many.
In Quebec, Dostie-Goulet (2009b) finds that 14- to 17-year-old
teenagers' political interest is better predicted by the frequency of
political discussions with their parents than with friends, while
discussions with history class teachers have a significant but lesser
influence on children's political interest. In Sweden, Shehata and Amnå
(2019) finds that 13- to 18-year-old teenagers' political interest is
mostly affected by parents' political interest, with peers also having
an important influence but not long-lasting effects. In Finland,
Koskimaa and Rapeli (2015) find that 16- to 18-year-olds' political
interest is mainly related to the presence of politics in their family
and among their friends, with friends being the most important
influence, contrary to Dostie-Goulet's (2009b) and Shehata and Amnå's
(2019) results. The influence of school is marginally statistically
significant. Finally, Jennings and Niemi (1981) and Neundorf, Smets, and
Garcia-Albacete (2013) find that parents' role in political interest
transmission mostly occurs during teenage years, while other factors
explain growth among adults.

In practice, two main theories may help explain the gendered influence
of these four agents in transmitting political interest to children:
\emph{social learning theory} and \emph{gender homophily theory}. Both
theories point to a broad influence of same-gender role models in
socialization.

\hypertarget{social-learning-theory}{%
\paragraph{Social learning theory}\label{social-learning-theory}}

\emph{Social learning theory} suggests that children learn through the
observation of their parents and peers, and model their behaviour,
attitudes, habits and values after them (Gidengil, Wass, and Valaste
2016; Shehata and Amnå 2019). Through this process of observation of
others, ``children gradually learn what is considered appropriate and
socially rewarded, and what is not in different contexts'' (Shehata and
Amnå 2019, 1058). Transmission of political attitudes is deemed to be
more effective when cue-giving and reinforcement from the socializing
agent are strong and consistent (Jennings, Stoker, and Bowers 2009;
Prior 2019).

While research about social learning and politics has most often been
applied to the transmission of political participation (Gidengil, Wass,
and Valaste 2016) or political engagement more generally (Jennings and
Niemi 1981), a few recent studies argue social learning can also apply
to orientations such as interest --- in this case, political interest.
Prior (2019) argues social learning can explain the transmission of
political interest from parents to children. He suggests this
transmission process can only occur at a time when children still live
in the family home and after they start acquiring an understanding of
what politics is --- that is, in the early teens. Shehata and Amnå
(2019) also hypothesize parents and peers who value current news affairs
knowledge can transmit their political interest to children through both
learning opportunities and social pressure. Learning opportunities can
occur through political discussions with parents and peers, or through
children's exposition to their parents watching or reading the news
daily, which can give them a more concrete understanding of how politics
affects their lives, a factor that predicts the development of political
interest. Social pressure can occur when children feel they need to take
an interest in politics to develop a sense of belonging or social
identity. Jennings, Stoker, and Bowers (2009) also highlight parents'
important role in fostering higher political engagement --- including
political interest --- among their children, linking that role to a
social learning process.

Research has found that social learning exhibits gender effects:
\emph{observer--model similarity} leads children to model their
behaviour, values and attitudes based on the behaviour, values and
attitudes of models that resemble them (Bandura 1969). Indeed, past
research has shown that the trickle-down effect of political engagement
from parents to children works in gendered ways, with sons modeling
their behaviour after their fathers and daughters after their mothers
(Gidengil, Wass, and Valaste 2016).\footnote{This dissertation uses the
  words ``mother'' and ``father'' without implying that there is exactly
  one mother and one father per family. Other situations are very
  common.} Political interest is also more strongly correlated between
mothers and daughters and between fathers and sons than any other
combination (Beauregard 2008; Neundorf, Smets, and Garcia-Albacete 2013;
Owen and Dennis 1988).

\hypertarget{gender-homophily-theory}{%
\paragraph{Gender homophily theory}\label{gender-homophily-theory}}

\emph{Homophily} is ``the principle that a contact between similar
people occurs at a higher rate than among dissimilar people''
(McPherson, Smith-Lovin, and Cook 2001, 416). \emph{Gender homophily}
refers to the ways in which children of the same gender tend to stick
together and become friends, from at least the beginning of primary
school (Stehlé et al. 2013). Children are even more likely to drop
friends who have a friend from the other gender than to add the
other-gender friend to their own group of friends (McPherson,
Smith-Lovin, and Cook 2001). These patterns increase during primary
school but diminish --- without disappearing --- after puberty (Shrum,
Cheek Jr., and Hunter 1988; Stehlé et al. 2013).

Studies about gender homophily in social networking websites among
teenagers and adults have yielded more nuanced results. Thelwall (2009)
finds that MySpace users have similar levels of interactions regardless
of their gender. However, Laniado et al. (2016) find strong gender
homophily among adolescent girls and boys --- though not always for the
same kinds of online activities --- on a Spanish social networking
service.

\hypertarget{political-interest-dissected-interest-in-different-political-topics}{%
\section{Political Interest Dissected: Interest in Different Political
Topics}\label{political-interest-dissected-interest-in-different-political-topics}}

Perhaps as a result of social learning processes, research has found
that men and women are often interested in different issues. It is
therefore possible that women are simply interested in aspects of
politics which they do not always see as political. Studies have
suggested the typically reported gender gap in political interest might
be the result of inadequate measurement (Alozie, Simon, and Merrill
2003; Bourque and Grossholtz 1974; Keeling 2023; Tormos and Verge 2022).
While Alozie, Simon, and Merrill (2003) use a very broad concept of
``political orientation'' including discussion, attention, and
participation in various activities, recent studies have found a
creative way of addressing the limitations of the traditional measure of
political interest. On average, women report more interest in topics
such as health care, education and gender issues, while men report more
interest in foreign policy, partisan politics, and law and order, and
topics such as taxes and local politics seem to be equally interesting
to men and women (R. Campbell and Winters 2008; Coffé 2013; Ferrin et
al. 2020; Hayes and Bean 1993; Kuhn 2004; Sabella 2004a; Tormos and
Verge 2022; Verba, Burns, and Schlozman 1997). These studies generally
conclude that men and women are simply interested in different domains
of politics and that politics is mentally associated with elections and
parties, topics in which men have more interest,\footnote{This mental
  association might be culture-specific to some degree. Conceptions of
  politics could be more removed from partisan politics in other
  situations such as Northwest Territories' and Nunavut's non-partisan
  legislative assemblies, but also in authoritarian one-party regimes.}
therefore leading women to report lower levels of political interest
overall. Tormos and Verge (2022) find that prompting for interest in
several topics for which women typically report more interest, including
gender issues and health care, makes women and men rate their political
interest similarly, with an increase in political interest stronger
among women than among men. Conversely, prompting respondents for
partisan politics slightly reduces political interest among both men and
women, but more strongly among women. Keeling (2023) uses a similar
research design and also finds that prompting for interest in several
topics including gender issues reduces the gender gap in self-reported
political interest, although this decline is due to a decline in
self-reported political interest among men rather than an increase among
women.\footnote{Among institutional and structural mentioned in the
  previous section, it is unclear whether these factors explain the
  gender gap in partisan political interest only, or interest in several
  political topics too.}

Why would women be more interested in health care, education and gender
issues specifically? Kuhn (2004) argues that women's ``political
thinking revolves around terms of compassion and cooperation, not around
contest and competition. Females are interested in solving concrete
problems and are driven by social empathy, egalitarian values, and
engagement for other people. {[}\ldots{]} Females prefer unconventional
forms of political participation'' (96). Women's higher interest in
gender issues such as abortion and gender-based violence can be
explained by the fact that these issues are more likely to affect them
directly (Ferrin et al. 2020). For similar reasons, R. Campbell and
Winters (2008) suggest that women's higher interest in health services
matches with statistics suggesting that women are more frequent users of
these services compared to men. Moreover, women's ``continuing
disproportionate share of childcare responsibilities may also lead them
to be more interested in issues relating to education and social
services'' (64). Stolle and Gidengil (2010) also find women give better
answers than men to knowledge questions about the health care system,
and scholars have found strong links between political interest and
political knowledge --- the former often predicting the latter (Elo and
Rapeli 2010; Pettey 1988; Prior 2019).

Why would men be more interested in foreign policy, partisan politics,
and law and order? The competitive nature of partisan politics seems to
tap into men's tendency towards agency, leading them to express more
interest in that aspect of politics. While studies are unclear about why
men report more interest in foreign policy and law and order, it is
possible to argue that men's higher rates of incarceration, stronger
presence in the police force, and overrepresentation among world leaders
could lead them to take more interest in these areas. Stolle and
Gidengil (2010) also find men give better answers than women to
knowledge questions about partisan politics.

The reasonings behind differences in interest for different topics often
center around a dichotomy between competition and cooperation, which may
have to do with different personality traits --- also potentially
resulting from socialization.

\hypertarget{personality-traits}{%
\subsection{Personality Traits}\label{personality-traits}}

More specifically, gender may affect some personality traits that are
relevant to the development and types of political interest. Rancer and
Dierks-Stewart (1985) show that biological sex does not predict
argumentativeness, while gender identity does, with masculine
individuals more argumentative than feminine individuals. They measure
gender identity using a scale of \emph{expressive} (feminine) and
\emph{instrumental} (masculine) behaviours. In a literature review,
Infante and Rancer (1996) similarly find that men are more likely than
women to value arguing and engage in it, except for workplace-related
arguing. Similarly, Shaw (2002) finds that female MPs in the United
Kingdom are less likely to resort to adversarial language than male MPs.
Experimental studies by Niederle and Vesterlund (2007) and Kanthak and
Woon (2015) also find that men are less risk-averse than women and tend
to value competition more than women do, although Sevi and Blais (2023)
find the opposite to be true, with women showing as much willingness as
men, or perhaps slightly more, to participate in competitive elections.
Individuals also tend to think men are better than women at negotiating,
something that is then internalized by women who behave according to
gender-based expectations, according to a United States study and a
literature review (Eckel, De Oliveira, and Grossman 2008; Kray,
Thompson, and Galinsky 2001; A. K. Schneider 2017).

These differences seem to be politically relevant since a recent British
study by R. Campbell and Winters (2008) shows that men's higher
self-reported political interest derives from the fact that they are
more \emph{agentic}, i.e., focused on self-assertion, while women are
more \emph{communal}, i.e., focused on cooperation. Since the concept of
\emph{politics} is typically seen as more adversarial, it appeals more
to agentic types --- mostly men --- who then develop higher political
efficacy and overall self-reported political interest, a finding also
shared by M. C. Schneider et al. (2016). Yet, our definition of politics
includes both its competitive and cooperative aspects.

\hypertarget{hypotheses-towards-a-unified-socialization-theory}{%
\section{Hypotheses: Towards a Unified Socialization
Theory}\label{hypotheses-towards-a-unified-socialization-theory}}

This dissertation asks \emph{``How do men and women differ with regards
to political interest, and why?''} It hypothesizes that political
socialization plays a central role in explaining the emergence of gender
differences in interest in political interest, with parents and peers
the most important agents of childhood political socialization.
Furthermore, it emphasizes that gender differences are more about the
type of political interest rather than the level of political interest.

While gender tendencies towards communality and agency respectively
contribute to women's interest in health care and men's interest in
partisan politics,\footnote{These processes might be reinforced by
  societal expectations about men's and women's roles, although this
  explanation is more structural than socialization-driven.} a broader
application of socialization theories that includes parents and peers
would provide a more comprehensive understanding of who influences girls
and boys in how much interest they have in various aspects of politics.
Gender homophily and social learning both suggest that children are
influenced by same-gender role models, but these theories need to be
further specified. A broad application of social learning theory would
predict a parent's political interest influences the development of
their children's political interest more strongly for their same-gender
children than other-gender children, but whether this applies to
interest in political topics other than partisan politics has not been
tested. On the other hand, gender homophily predicts more same-gender
than mixed-gender peer discussions, and this finding applies to
political discussions as well. However, no study has thus far examined
the implications of this theory for gender differences in political
interest.

The study seeks to bridge two literatures on gender, socialization, and
political interest; one emphasizing personality traits leading to
interest in different political topics, and the other emphasizing the
transmission of political interest by same-gender role models. The goal
is to measure interest in various political topics and link it to
parents' and peers' interest in those same topics. This is something
that has not been done before; parents' and children's political
interest is typically compared using a single measure of political
interest, but we do not know if same-gender role models have the same
impact on interest transmission for each political topic.

\emph{\textbf{Hypothesis 1}: Children's interest in specific political
topics is more affected by political discussions with their same-gender
parent(s) than other-gender parent(s).}

\emph{\textbf{Hypothesis 2}: Children's interest in specific political
topics is more affected by political discussions with their same-gender
peers than other-gender peers.}

According to Hypothesis 1, on average, a mother will have more
transmission potential of her interest in specific political topics to
her daughters than sons through political discussion, for example.
Hypothesis 2 uses the same logic for same-gender peers. Hypotheses 1 and
2 are summarized in Figure~\ref{fig-hypotheses}, with a few additional
background details. Put neatly, the general theory is that
\emph{children's interest in specific political topics comes mainly from
socialization by their same-gender parent(s) and peers}.

\hypertarget{organization-of-the-dissertation}{%
\section{Organization of the
Dissertation}\label{organization-of-the-dissertation}}

This dissertation mostly relies on survey data collected among Canadian
children and teenagers. Chapter~\ref{sec-chap2} outlines the data and
methods used in all other chapters of this dissertation. It also
provides descriptive statistics about some of the main variables used in
the data analysis, including gender, personality traits, role models,
interest in various political topics, and socio-demographic variables.

The next four chapters are empirical. Chapter~\ref{sec-chap3} studies
the evolution of political interest through life, answering questions
about the stability of political interest and of the gender gap in
self-reported political interest. Chapter~\ref{sec-chap4} explores the
role of parents in the transmission of political interest and provides
the answer to Hypothesis 1. Chapter~\ref{sec-chap5} does the same for
the role of peers, answering Hypothesis 2, while Chapter~\ref{sec-chap6}
assesses the influence of teachers and social media influencers. The
role of school and media has been emphasized by some studies, but the
extent to which gendered effects will be present is less certain.

Finally, Chapter~\ref{sec-chap7} provides an overall assessment of the
influence of role models on the development of political interest among
children and teenagers, and of the extent to which socialization can
explain political interest gender gaps. Its overarching goals are to
provide a better understanding of how men and women view politics
differently, to raise awareness about this discrepancy and to provide
recommendations for actors who seek to encourage interest in some --- or
many --- political topics among adult citizens and future adult citizens
of both genders.

\chapter{Data, Methods and Descriptive Statistics}\label{sec-chap2}}

This chapter seeks to explain the dissertation's datasets, methods, and
analyse descriptive statistics about the main explanatory and outcome
variables used in the next chapters. It seeks to answer the following
question: How can we study the development of political interest through
gendered socialization processes? The types of analyses, survey weights,
and decisions about which variables to include are provided.

\hfill\break

Chapter~\ref{sec-chap1} has established that political interest is an
important predictor of political discussion and of more concrete forms
of political engagement, which makes this concept worthy of scientific
inquiry. Measuring political interest, its development, and the
socialization processes that lead to it requires a methodological
approach that relies on data collected among both children and adults.
It also requires the data collected among children to inquire about all
potential sources of socialization --- parents, peers, media, and
schools. The measurement of gendered personality traits among children
--- self-assertion for boys and co-operation for girls --- is also an
important factor that may explain how transmission processes work. This
chapter answers the following question: \emph{How can we study the
development of political interest through gendered socialization
processes?} It starts by detailing the datasets and methods that will be
used throughout the chapters of this dissertation. It also provides
descriptive statistics about some of the main variables that will be
used, notably those related to political interest as well as
socio-economic status. Before doing so, it provides a brief explanation
of the case selection.

\hypertarget{why-canada}{%
\section{Why Canada?}\label{why-canada}}

The data used for this dissertation comes from Canada, the country I
live in and know best. As Noël (2014) puts it, studying one's own
country produces social scientific knowledge that is directly relevant
to and usable by citizens of that country, and it therefore has a
uniquely important character. Moreover, for the current study, Canada is
a particularly interesting country to study, given that it is often
classified by reports as one of the best for women to live in (Conant
2019; Equal Measures 2030 2020; US News \& World Report 2020), even
though only 30.7\% of elected MPs are women, the 61st highest percentage
among the world's 193 countries (Inter-Parliamentary Union Parline
2023). Canadian Election Study (CES) data since 1997 shows that the
gender gap in political interest has remained fairly stable despite a
recent increase in the percentage of women politicians at the national
and provincial levels (Sevi 2021). These characteristics make Canada a
country worth studying to better understand the underlying reasons
behind the stability of the gender gap in the aggregate measure of
political interest, which mainly taps into interest in partisan
politics. Studies that measure interest in different political topics
have been conducted in Europe and the Middle East, but it is unclear how
the gender differences they find for many topics apply in Canada.
Studying the transmission of political interest to children in Canada
seems like a promising place to look for explanations of these gender
differences that may, or may not, apply elsewhere.

\hypertarget{data}{%
\section{Data}\label{data}}

Given the abstract nature of political interest, the observation of
children's behaviour would not provide an accurate answer to this
dissertation's questions. Political interest is different from frequency
of political discussions, and different from political participation.
Surveys, compared with interviews or focus groups, make it easier to get
reliable interest scores that can be compared across respondents of
different backgrounds. Interviews and focus groups are also more likely
to be subject to social desirability bias than surveys --- students
might overestimate their interest in politics and the frequency of
discussions with parents. This dissertation therefore relies on survey
data.

Within Canada, this dissertation relies on five datasets as well as the
2021 Canadian Census. Two of these datasets have been collected for this
dissertation while the other three are large-scale surveys mobilized to
provide extra context and better estimates of political engagement in
Canada --- and its evolution as Canadians age. The two datasets which
were collected for this dissertation share similar questions about
political interest and about interest in five specific political topics:
health care, international affairs, law and crime, education, and
partisan politics. These five topics are those for which past studies
have reported the largest gender differences in interest: women
typically report being more interested in the political aspects of
health care and education, while men typically report being more
interested in the political aspects of the other three topics mentioned
(R. Campbell and Winters 2008; Coffé 2013; Ferrin et al. 2020; Hayes and
Bean 1993; Kuhn 2004; Sabella 2004a; Verba, Burns, and Schlozman 1997).

\subsection{Canadian Children Political Interest Survey
(CCPIS)}\label{canadian-children-political-interest-survey-ccpis}}

To create the Canadian Children Political Interest Survey (CCPIS), data
was collected among 698 Canadian children and adolescents aged 8 to 18
from seven elementary and secondary schools and one school board's
Student Senate, all located in various urban areas of Quebec and
Ontario,\footnote{All are considered urban since they are part of a
  census metropolitan area (CMA) as defined by Statistics Canada
  (2023a).} between August 2022 and January 2023. Students had to fill a
15-minute online survey questionnaire during classroom time, under
supervision by their teacher, who gave them the link to fill the survey.
The survey was hosted on the Qualtrics Web platform and was available in
both French and English. This part of the data collection received
clearance from the University of Toronto's Social Sciences, Humanities
and Education Research Ethics Board. It seems worthwhile to study
political socialization in the period of life where political interest
is developed to better understand gender differences since there seems
to be some level of path dependency in individuals' political interest
afterwards (Prior 2010, 2019).

Table~\ref{tbl-descriptive} shows the number of classrooms and students
in each of the eight schools included in the final sample of the CCPIS,
as well as additional information about the schools. Participating
schools include a mix of private and public schools in Quebec and
Ontario, including students from all age groups.

In total, 75 school boards,\footnote{This figure also includes
  institutions known under names such as school service centers, school
  divisions, school districts, school councils, and centers for
  education.} 47 public schools, and 83 private schools across Canada
were originally contacted to take part in the project. Of the 75 school
boards that were contacted, 10 accepted to be part of the study (13\%),
15 refused (20\%), 27 did not reply to emails (36\%), and 23 did not
follow through or required extensive information that was impossible to
provide (31\%). On that last point, several school boards required
extensive documentation about the study or background police checks,
even for virtual data collection, and most of those who were sent that
information still refused to take part in the study after the
documentation was provided to them, often citing a lack of time. Of the
132 schools that were contacted, 10 accepted (8\%), 9 refused (7\%), 2
were deemed ineligible after checking (2\%), 88 did not respond (67\%)
--- in most cases after several attempts --- and 21 stopped replying
after a few email exchanges (16\%). Among the schools that accepted to
take part in the study, 13 teachers made their students fill the survey
(59\% of all teachers contacted).\footnote{Non-response and rejection
  rates after the first contact are not reported by Dostie-Goulet
  (2009b), Prior (2019), Neundorf, Smets, and Garcia-Albacete (2013) or
  other similar studies about political interest among children and
  teenagers.}

The proportion of schools and school boards who refused to take part in
the CCPIS is admittedly high. Two main factors are likely at play.
First, schools often cited a lack of time or specified they had already
said yes to a number of other academic projects. The demands on schools
and teachers are high, and a study about socialization may not rank
among their short-term priorities. Second, despite the emphasis in all
documentation and emails about the ease of the process --- with very few
drawbacks on teachers other than coordinating a 15-minute survey period
where students could use either their phones or laptops to fill the
survey --- there was no direct benefit for schools, financial or other.
Such payments to schools may have raised concerns among schools or
parents.

Within each classroom, 18 students filled the survey on average --- a
number that rises to 22 per classroom when removing school 5, whose
students did not have an allocated classroom period to fill the survey
and therefore did so out of their free time. 22 per classroom is a
number very close to the average 20 to 24 students per classroom in
Ontario and Quebec schools (Bolduc 2023).\footnote{Dostie-Goulet (2009a)
  and Dostie-Goulet (2009b) also reported high within-class response
  rates of 90\% and 80\% respectively.} In total, the 698 students who
took part in the survey, while not as large as the 1,000 generally
reached in regular cross-country opinion polling in Canada, make it
possible to analyze trends that go beyond the local or school level with
sufficient statistical power.

Low response rates for schools and school boards imply that the sample's
descriptive characteristics should not be seen as representative of the
Canadian student population. This sample should be considered a
non-random, convenience sample. Nevertheless, as will become clearer
when examining student-level descriptive statistics, there is no
theoretical reason to believe that the types of correlations studied
here --- transmission of political interest by role models --- should be
affected by the convenience nature of the sample. Given the scarcity of
available data on school-aged children's political predispositions
within Canada, this dataset also provides relevant information about
students' interests, role models, and relation to politics. The core of
the data analysis in each chapter therefore relies on this dataset.

The CCPIS includes information about students' interest in various
political topics, the political topics they say they discuss with their
mothers, fathers and peers, as well as the political topics discussed by
a teacher and an influencer they like. The gender of these role models
is also inquired, to test the implication from social learning theory
that political interest transmission should occur mainly between a child
and role models of their gender, more than role models of other genders
(Prior 2019; Shehata and Amnå 2019).

For questions about students' political interests, the following
questions are asked: ``How interested are you in politics generally? Set
the slider to a number from 0 to 10, where 0 means no interest at all,
and 10 means a great deal of interest'', and ``If you were to open a
news website and see the following articles how interested would you be
in reading each article? Set the slider to a number from 0 to 10, where
0 means `Not at all interested, I would not read it,' and 10 means `Very
interested, I would most likely read it.' (a) Health care (i.e.,
pandemic restrictions, working conditions of nurses); (b) International
affairs (i.e., diplomatic disputes between Canada and China, Ukrainian
war); (c) Law and crime (i.e., police funding, sentences for violent
crimes); (d) Education (i.e., university tuition, funding of public and
private schools); (e) Partisan politics (i.e., federal elections,
political parties)''. These questions specify concrete examples of
political issues related to each topic, in order to make the political
aspects of these topics more salient and avoid students answering while
thinking about their own health or classes they are taking. The
question's phrasing is meant to be easily understood by children and
teenagers.

The questionnaire was pre-tested on two teenagers, a boy and a girl aged
12. Minor adjustments were made to the questionnaire to ensure children
of all ages would understand the questions asked of them, notably with
international relations topics. This involved selecting more recent
events (i.e., the Ukrainian War and diplomatic disputes between Canada
and China) rather than events that occurred a longer time ago. Since
topics with some degree of importance in recent news were selected, both
topics chosen also embody competitive rather than cooperative aspects of
international relations, which may reinforce agentic children --- more
often boys according to past research --- to report more interest in
them. The questionnaire's length was also deemed to be reasonable during
these pre-tests.

The main socialization-related explanatory variables for children's
political interest identified in the literature concern the role of four
agents of socialization: parents, peers, schools, and media. In order to
determine the importance of these role models' gender, the following
questions were asked to children: ``Which parent do you discuss most
often with? (a) Mother; (b) Father; (c) Both equally''; ``What is the
gender of most of your friends? (a) Girls; (b) Boys; (c) About the same
for both genders''; ``Think about a teacher that you like(d). Is that
teacher\ldots{} (a) A woman; (b) A man; (c) Other (e.g.~Trans,
non-binary, two-spirit, gender-queer)''; ``Think about someone that you
like and sometimes read or watch on social media --- including YouTube.
Is that person\ldots{} (a) A man; (b) A woman; (c) Other (e.g.~Trans,
non-binary, two-spirit, gender-queer).'' These questions make it
possible to assess the influence of role models, but also to test its
interaction effect with role models' gender. Questions are then asked
about the topics most discussed by parents, peers, teachers and
influencers among the five political topics highlighted beforehand.

The CCPIS also uses the Personal Attributes Questionnaire (Spence and
Helmreich 1978; Ward et al. 2006) to assess students' degrees of agency
and communality, and to assess whether interest correlations between
children and their same-gender role models change when controlling for
the child's degree of agency or communality. Men are typically more
assertive, which brings them closer to partisan politics, while women
are typical more co-operative, which leads them to be more interested in
topics such as health care and education. Given the importance of the
agency/communality distinction in explaining gender differences in
political interest (R. Campbell and Winters 2008), this hypothesis is
tested alongside hypotheses about the role of parents, peers and other
role models.

Finally, the CCPIS asks socio-demographic questions about children's
gender, language spoken at home, immigrant status, age, and ethnicity.
These questions are mostly inspired by the Canadian Election Study
(Stephenson et al. 2020), except for the question on ethnicity, which is
based on the 2016 Census (Statistics Canada 2017). No question is asked
about students' socio-economic background or their parents' level of
education since this information may be difficult for them to reliably
assess.\footnote{Data about schools' socio-economic level is available
  for public schools in Quebec, but only one public Quebec school took
  part in the CCPIS.} The English and French CCPIS questionnaires are
available in Appendix~\ref{sec-appendix1} and
Appendix~\ref{sec-appendix2}.

\subsection{Datagotchi Post-Election Survey (Datagotchi
PES)}\label{datagotchi-post-election-survey-datagotchi-pes}}

The second dataset collected over the course of this dissertation is the
2022 Quebec Datagotchi Post-Election Survey, which includes data on
2,228 Quebec adult respondents (Leadership Chair in the Teaching of
Digital Social Sciences 2023). This dataset was collected in February
and March 2023 using a panel of respondents which agreed to be contacted
by email during the 2022 Quebec general election through the Datagotchi
Web app (Leadership Chair in the Teaching of Digital Social Sciences
2022). Opt-in surveys like this one are typically more reliable but less
externally valid than traditional surveys (Herrick et al. 2019; Thielo,
Graham, and Cullen 2021). For the purposes of this dissertation, the
questions of interest which were asked to panel respondents inquired
about their level of interest in the five aforementioned political
topics and general socio-economic status. For these questions, the same
question wording was used than among students, with the same five
political topics. The Datagotchi Post-Election Survey French
questionnaire is available in Appendix~\ref{sec-appendix3}.

\hypertarget{cross-country-datasets}{%
\subsection{Cross-Country Datasets}\label{cross-country-datasets}}

Other than these two main datasets, three often-used datasets including
Canadian respondents are mobilized to give a more general empirical
overlook on political interest in Canada. These datasets include only
one question about political interest --- rather than interest in five
topics --- but each of them asks about other forms of political
engagement --- which will further be analyzed in Chapter~\ref{sec-chap3}
--- and two of them provide time-series data about political interest
and engagement, while the third provides a less political questionnaire
and therefore provides data about a different crowd of Canadian
respondents which may be more representative of Canadians' overall level
of interest in politics.

First, Canadian Election Study (CES) data on various aspects of
political engagement is analyzed (Stephenson et al. 2022). Other than
typical socio-economic status questions, the CES includes data about
political interest, political knowledge, internal efficacy, external
efficacy, political discussion, political debating, participation in
protests, participation in boycotts, participation in petitions, party
membership, donations to parties, and voting. CES data allows time
series analyses of the evolution of gender gaps, with some political
engagement questions having been asked since 1965. There were 20,968
respondents to the 2021 CES.

Second, time-series World Values Survey (WVS) data is also used. These
data, like CES data, make it possible to visually represent descriptive
statistics by age and gender on political engagement. Moreover, the
World Values Survey (WVS) Wave 7 (2017--22) includes data from Canada
(2020) and 56 other countries, therefore providing the opportunity for
cross-country comparisons on political interest and political engagement
(Haerpfer et al. 2022). Other than typical socio-economic status
questions, respondents were asked a different political interest
question than in other surveys: ``How interested would you say you are
in politics? (a) Very interested; (b) Somewhat interested; (c) Not very
interested; (d) Not at all interested'' (Haerpfer et al.
2022).\footnote{This 4-point scale is transformed into a 0--10 scale
  comparable with the CES's political interest scale, using the same
  method as Prior (2010).} Time-series data about political interest are
also used in some analyses, with political interest questions being
asked as early as 1982 in some countries. There were 4,018 Canadian
respondents to the 2020 WVS and 84,638 for wave 7 worldwide.

Third, the 2013 and 2020 Canadian General Social Survey (GSS), cycles 27
and 35 (Social Identity), are also used to get data about Canadians'
political interest and engagement coming from a less political survey.
The GSS's political interest questions asks ``Generally speaking, how
interested are you in politics? (e.g., international, national,
provincial or municipal) (a) Very interested; (b) Somewhat interested;
(c) Not very interested; (d) Not at all interested'' (Statistics Canada
2023b). There were 34,044 respondents to the 2020 GSS.

\hypertarget{canadian-census}{%
\subsection{Canadian Census}\label{canadian-census}}

Finally, data from the 2021 Canadian Census is used to compare data from
all other sources to Canadian population figures (Statistics Canada
2022) --- or Quebec population figures, in the case of the Datagotchi
PES. More specifically, the Individual Public Use Microdata Files (PUMF)
are used to cross-reference data. The PUMF includes data collected among
980,868 Canadians, or a representative segment of 2.7\% of the Canadian
population. These data are specifically meant to be used to create
survey weights and calculate aggregate statistics about the Canadian
population, which I do with the Datagotchi PES data.

\hypertarget{avoiding-social-desirability-bias}{%
\subsection{Avoiding Social Desirability
Bias}\label{avoiding-social-desirability-bias}}

Questions about political interest can be subject to some degree of
social desirability bias, which is ``the difference between an
individual's own intention and his/her perception of his/her peers'
intention'' (Chung and Monroe 2003, 296). Respondents may want to
portray themselves as ``good citizens'' who are interested in public
affairs, regardless of their real interest in politics. However, it is
not entirely clear whether girls' scores or boys' scores would be more
inflated as a result of social desirability bias. Studies have found
that in Canada, Australia, and the United States, \emph{women} generally
exhibit higher social desirability bias when answering survey questions
(Chung and Monroe 2003; Cohen, Pant, and Sharp 1998, 2001). However,
studies in these same countries and more instead show that \emph{men}
are more likely to over-report having voted in the previous elections
(Belli, Traugott, and Beckmann 2001; Herrick and Pryor 2020; Stockemer
and Sundstrom 2023). For political interest, it is unclear which gender
--- if any --- tends to over-report it, but disaggregating the concept
in five topics might be the best approach to avoid systematic social
desirability bias associated with one particular question. This is
therefore the approach taken throughout this dissertation.

\hypertarget{controlling-for-classroom-level-effects}{%
\subsection{Controlling for Classroom-Level
Effects}\label{controlling-for-classroom-level-effects}}

In the CCPIS dataset, students are clustered within classrooms, which
are themselves nested within schools and provinces. There may be some
schools or classrooms in which relationships between socialization and
political interest develop differently. Multilevel regressions with two
levels are therefore used to help disentangle classroom-level effects
from individual-level effects. Since the numbers of schools (8) and
provinces (2) in the final sample are too low for multilevel regressions
to be conducted, only classroom-level fixed effects are used in the
analyses.

Empty models are calculated to assess what percentage in the total
variance in political interest --- and in each of the five topics --- is
located at the classroom level. Results show that 6.2\% of variance in
political interest is located at the classroom level, as well as 4.6\%
of variance in interest in health care, 3.6\% of variance in interest in
international affairs, 1.4\% of variance in interest in law and crime,
8.1\% of variance in interest in education, and 2.6\% of variance in
interest in partisan politics. In all cases, the bulk of variance
therefore seems to be located at another level than the classroom ---
presumably the individual level.

The four datasets collected among adults do not involve individuals
clustered within classrooms or other broader groupings of interest for
this study. Instead of multilevel regressions, simple and multiple
ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions are instead performed.

\hypertarget{what-are-potential-confounding-variables-to-links-between-socialization-and-political-interest}{%
\subsection{What are Potential Confounding Variables to Links Between
Socialization and Political
Interest?}\label{what-are-potential-confounding-variables-to-links-between-socialization-and-political-interest}}

Other than Chapter~\ref{sec-chap3}, which takes a time-series approach
to studying political interest, most analyses of the coming chapters
have political interest as the outcome variable and rely on CCPIS data.
Typically, a simple regression model with one explanatory variable ---
often a given role model's interest in a specific topic --- is followed
by multiple regression models with control variables for three blocs of
variables: (1) personality traits, (2) role models' gender, and (3)
socio-economic status variables. Personality traits include the agency
and communality scales described in the following section, while
socio-economic status variables include confounding variables which have
been linked with political interest and could therefore mediate any
given relationship found between two persons' political interest. These
include gender, age --- Chapter~\ref{sec-chap3} explores the
relationships between gender, age and political interest in more detail
--- as well as language, ethnicity, and immigrant status. For analyses
involving adult data, income and level of education, both of which can
also be linked to political interest, are also added as control
variables.

\hypertarget{descriptive-statistics}{%
\section{Descriptive Statistics}\label{descriptive-statistics}}

\hypertarget{general}{%
\subsection{General}\label{general}}

Before analyzing average levels of interest in politics in each of the
datasets, it is first important to assess the extent to which each of
them is (un)representative of the Canadian population on some of the
main socio-economic status variables that may relate to political
interest, including age, gender, education, income, and so on. In cases
where the data is deemed unrepresentative, a weighting method is applied
and described.

Figure~\ref{fig-ccpis1} shows the distribution of CCPIS students by age,
gender, language, ethnicity, immigrant status, degree of agency and
communality, and family situation. Most respondents are aged 12 to 17,
with a large proportion (41\%) being exactly 16 years old. This roughly
corresponds to the moment when adolescents' political interest starts
increasing alongside a gender gap in which boys report being more
interested in politics (Fraile and Sánchez-Vítores 2020; Janmaat,
Hoskins, and Pensiero 2022; Prior 2019). This age distribution should
make it possible to assess the influence of all types of role models at
the moment when they are the most likely to be influential for students'
political interest. The sample is therefore compared with 2021 Census
microdata on 12--17-year-old Canadian teenagers. The gender composition
of the sample is roughly balanced, with 50.4\% of girls and 47.1\% of
boys while, among all Canadians, 51.5\% of teenagers are boys and 48.5\%
are girls.\footnote{The number of transgender and non-binary people for
  this age group is not disclosed in the microdata.} Respondents are
mainly white --- 57.9\%, which is close to the Canadian average of
59.8\%. They are also overwhelmingly Francophone due to the
over-representation of Quebec within sampled schools --- 66.5\% mostly
speak French at home, which is much higher than the Canadian average of
18.3\% --- but several students who mainly speak another language than
English or French at home have also filled the survey --- 25\%, which is
higher than the Canadian average of 13.2\%. 84.4\% of students in the
sample were born in Canada --- close to the 86.8\% countrywide average.
The distributions of agency and communality among students both follow a
bell-shaped distribution centered around the averages of 0.62 and 0.68
respectively. Most students live with one mother and one father
(71.8\%), with a substantial minority (18.3\%) also having stepparents.
Other family arrangements are less common. Other than language and
province, these students do not appear to be markedly different from the
Canadian teenager population on the main socio-demographic variables.
Descriptive statistics about role models' gender and interest in
political topics are analyzed in Chapter~\ref{sec-chap4},
Chapter~\ref{sec-chap5}, and Chapter~\ref{sec-chap6}, alongside further
analysis related to these role models' influence on children's political
interest.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{_graphs/CCPISDescriptive1.pdf}

}

\caption{\label{fig-ccpis1}CCPIS Descriptive Statistics - General}

\end{figure}

For agency and communality, scales are replicated from Ward et al.
(2006). Factor analysis in Figure~\ref{fig-factor1} and
Figure~\ref{fig-factor2} show that, with one exception on the agency
list --- an item that was reverse-coded\footnote{This could be a data
  quality issue, since this is the only question for which the agentic
  pole is reverse-coded among the first eight questions asked to
  children, and none of the communality scale questions are
  reverse-coded. This means some children might have paid less attention
  to the actual question and responded quickly. However, given the fact
  that the non-reverse-coded measure is also unrelated to other elements
  of the scale, and since children responded differently to the agency
  and communality scales, this seems to be a minor concern. The scale is
  an exact replication of the one used by Ward et al. (2006).} --- all
items scale well together, with factor loadings at least medium ---
above 0.3 (Shevlin et al. 2000) --- and first eigenvalues larger than
the conventionally accepted value of 1 (Williams, Onsman, and Brown
2010). The Cronbach's alpha for the agency scale (0.63) is slightly
under the 0.7 to 0.9 range suggested by scholars (Tavakol and Dennick
2011), while it is within that range for the communality scale (0.78),
therefore meeting the standard benchmarks for valid and reliable scales
established in peer-reviewed studies about measurement scales.

Figure~\ref{fig-dg} shows descriptive statistics for the Datagotchi PES,
which is not a representative sample before a form of weighting is
applied. The unweighted sample includes an over-representation of men
(56.8\%), white people (97.2\%), Francophones (94\% responded to the
French version of the survey), university-educated people (71\%), people
born in Canada (86\%), and those with a yearly household income over
\$110,000 (45\%). By comparison, Census numbers among adult Quebeckers
are 49.3\% of men, 82.1\% of white people, 82.1\% of people who speak
French more than English, 28.2\% university-educated people, 80.7\%
people born in Canada, and 34.3\% with a yearly household income above
\$110,000 (Statistics Canada 2022). The median age is 46, with a bimodal
distribution centered around 35--40 and 65, compared with a median age
within the 50--54 years old range among adult Quebeckers.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{_graphs/DGDescriptive1.pdf}

}

\caption{\label{fig-dg}Datagotchi PES Descriptive Statistics - General}

\end{figure}

Given the mismatch between many of these characteristics --- notably
gender, level of education and ethnicity --- and the Quebec population,
survey weights are created and used to make the the Datagotchi PES
sample more representative of the Quebec population as per the 2021
Census (Statistics Canada 2022) on these two aspects, as well as income
and age. Using the \texttt{anesrake} package which is used to weight
results from the American National Election Studies (Pasek 2018), a
raking procedure is used to produce these weights, which range from 0 to
5. Default settings of the \texttt{anesrake} function are used. After
using this procedure, the population percentages match with sample
percentages within 10 percentage points --- and typically less than 5
--- for each category of the five variables.

Figure~\ref{fig-ces} shows descriptive statistics for the 2021 CES.
Compared to 2021 Canadian Census data collected among adults (Statistics
Canada 2022), the unweighted sample includes a slight
over-representation of women --- 54.5\% vs.~51.1\% --- and a larger
over-representation of Allophones --- 33.1\% vs.~16.5\% --- of white
people --- 89.1\% vs.~70.2\% --- of university-educated people ---
54.4\% vs.~30.7\% --- and of people born in Canada --- 84.4\%
vs.~70.5\%. The median yearly household income is within the
\$60,001--\$90,000 range, which includes the narrower \$85,000 to
\$89,999 median range among adult Canadians. The median age is 53,
slightly above the median 45--49 age range for the adult Canadian
population, and there is again a bimodal distribution centered, this
time centered around 30--35 and 60--70. Respondents from Ontario are
slightly under-represented --- 35.0\% vs.~38.6\% --- while those from
Quebec are over-represented --- 29.6\% vs.~22.9\%. Given the mismatch
between many of these characteristics --- notably province, education
and age --- and the Canadian population, the CES's survey weights based
on the 2016 Census, which account for province, gender, age, and
education, are used. These weights' values vary between 0.2 and 5. After
using this procedure, the population percentages match with sample
percentages on these aspects.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{_graphs/CESDescriptive1.pdf}

\caption{\label{fig-ces}2021 CES Descriptive Statistics - General}

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig-wvs} shows descriptive statistics for the 2020 WVS in
Canada. Compared to 2021 Canadian Census data collected among adults,
the unweighted sample includes a similar proportion of women --- 48.8\%
vs.~51.1\% --- an under-representation of Allophones --- 6.0\%
vs.~16.5\% --- and an over-representation of university-educated people
--- 55.5\% vs.~30.7\% --- of white people --- 80.5\% vs.~70.2\% --- and
of people born in Canada --- 82.1\% vs.~70.5\%. The median age is 45,
which broadly matches with the median 45--49 age range for the adult
Canadian population. Respondents from Ontario are under-represented ---
25.0\% vs.~38.6\%. Given the mismatch between many of these
characteristics --- notably province and education --- and the Canadian
population, the WVS's survey weights for Canada based on the 2016
Census, which account for age, gender, education, and region, are used.
These weights' values vary between 0.12 and 3.69. After using this
procedure, the population percentages match with sample percentages on
these aspects.

Figure~\ref{fig-gss} shows descriptive statistics for the 2020 GSS.
Compared to 2021 Canadian Census data collected among adults (Statistics
Canada 2022), the unweighted sample includes a similar proportion of
women --- 51\% vs.~51.1\% --- an over-representation of Allophones ---
23.1\% vs.~16.5\% --- of university-educated people --- 40.8\%
vs.~30.7\% --- of visible minorities --- 42\% vs.~29.8\% --- and of
immigrants --- 41.1\% vs.~29.5\%. The median yearly household income is
within the \$50,000--\$74,999 range, compared with the higher \$85,000
to \$89,999 median range among adult Canadians. The median age is within
the 45--54 age range, which broadly matches with the median 45--49 age
range for the adult Canadian population. Respondents from Ontario are
slightly under-represented --- 34.4\% vs.~38.6\%. Given the mismatch
between many of these characteristics and the Canadian population, the
GSS's survey weights based on the 2016 Census, which account for gender,
age, province, CMA, and visible minority status, are used. These
weights' values vary between 1 and 32,631. After using this procedure,
the population percentages match with sample percentages on these
aspects.

\begin{figure}

Overall, the four studies conducted among adults have samples that vary
from each other. Some of them over-sample immigrants while others
under-sample them; some over-sample older citizens while others
under-sample them. A common theme in the three studies of Canadian
adults --- CES, WVS and GSS --- is the under-sampling of Ontarians.
However, all these variations are corrected using raking or
post-stratification weights.

\hypertarget{political-interest}{%
\subsection{Political Interest}\label{political-interest}}

After survey weights are applied, what is the average level of political
interest in each of the datasets? What is the distribution of political
interest among respondents, and which political topics are Canadians
most interested in? By looking at the distribution of political interest
among respondents topic by topic, this section lays the ground for
future chapters who will try to explain these political interest scores.

Figure~\ref{fig-ccpis2} shows the distribution of CCPIS students by
interest in politics by topic. 0 is associated with the lowest level of
interest and 10 with the highest. For all topics, 9 and 10 are among the
least common answers. International relations, and law and crime are
generally well-balanced, with students' mean interest above 5/10
(5.2--5.3). On the other hand, fewer students report high interest in
health care (4.1), education (4.1), or partisan politics (3.5). Partisan
politics in particular has a relatively steady positive skew, where the
mode is a 0/10 level of interest. For other topics, the distributions
are relatively wide, often taking a flattened bell shape.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{_graphs/CCPISDescriptive2.pdf}

}

\caption{\label{fig-ccpis2}CCPIS Descriptive Statistics - Political
Interest}

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig-dginterest} and Figure~\ref{fig-ceswvsgssinterest} show
the level of interest in politics among the four adult Canadian surveys,
including interest in the five topics in the case of the Datagotchi PES,
after survey weights are applied. While adult Quebeckers (Datagotchi
PES) report being more interested in each of the five topics compared
with Canadian students (CCPIS), interest in law and crime (5.5/10) is
lower than for other topics, followed by partisan politics (5.9/10).
General political interest (7.1/10) is higher on average than interest
in any of the five topics. Interest in the five political topics also
follows a more bell-shaped, normal distribution than what CCPIS found
among Canadian youth, although a negative skew can be found for all
topics. Canadian WVS respondents are slightly less interested in
politics (5.6/10) than those to the 2020 GSS and 2021 CES (6.0/10 and
6.1/10 respectively). Datagotchi PES respondents score an even higher
average general political interest score of 7.1/10, which might not be
surprising given the fact that these respondents are former users of the
Datagotchi Web app. Analyses using the Datagotchi PES throughout this
dissertation can therefore be considered to be a high bar for level of
interest in each of the political topics.

How can one make sense of these numbers? Are they relatively low or high
compared with what other studies have found in various countries among
respondents of different age groups? The next chapter will provide more
thorough answers to these questions while studying what period of life
is associated with the development of political interest.

\chapter{Gender and Political Interest Development: Canadian Trends from
Childhood to Adulthood}\label{sec-chap3}}

As Chapter~\ref{sec-chap1} showed, studies have long shown a gender gap
in political interest among adults in Western countries, in which men
report being more interested in politics than women, and one of the main
explanations for that gap is socialization. This process can be
influenced by four main agents: parents, peers, media and schools.
Moreover, when dissecting interests by topic, women typically develop
stronger interests in cooperation-focused political topics, while men
typically develop stronger interests in self-assertion-focused political
topics. Socialization can happen at various stages throughout the life
course. It can start from an early age but does not stop completely
after someone reaches adulthood. The timing of gendered political
socialization processes can be puzzling. This chapter therefore seeks to
provide an overview of how political interest evolves while Canadians
age. By identifying the critical periods of life in which political
interest can fluctuate, it will lay the groundwork for
Chapter~\ref{sec-chap4}, Chapter~\ref{sec-chap5} and
Chapter~\ref{sec-chap6}, which will focus their attention on explaining
how various socialization agents can influence the development of
political interest, especially among children and teenagers.

This chapter addresses two related questions: \emph{Throughout the
average person's life, when does political interest increase, decrease,
or remain stable? How does the evolution of political interest over the
life course differ between girls and boys, and later between women and
men?} After exploring what studies have found about these two questions
in various countries, the chapter uses a variety of Canadian and
international datasets to provide context-specific answers to these two
questions and break results down by age, gender, other socio-demographic
characteristics, other forms of political engagement and, most
importantly, interest in various political topics. This chapter
hypothesizes that for both boys and girls, adolescence is the moment in
time when gender differences in interest for various political topics
emerge. Notably, it is argued that boys develop more interest in
partisan politics, which is a contributing factor for their higher
interest in running for elected office when they reach adulthood.

\hypertarget{political-interest-evolution-over-the-life-course}{%
\section{Political Interest Evolution Over the Life
Course}\label{political-interest-evolution-over-the-life-course}}

Political interest is remarkably stable over the life course, as
longitudinal studies conducted in European countries have shown (Fraile
and Sánchez-Vítores 2020; Neundorf, Smets, and Garcia-Albacete 2013;
Prior 2010, 2019). This finding is robust to changes in survey question
wording. However, there is an important exception to this rule: children
start with a lower and less stable level of political interest than
adults.

Before the age of 15, it is unclear if children and teenagers experience
rising, falling or stable levels of interest in politics. In the United
States context, Hess and Torney (1967) find that children aged 7 to 14
report less and less political interest as they grow older, and Bos et
al. (2022) show the same for children aged 6 to 12. The explanation for
this decline is not provided, but it seems to affect mostly girls, a
result attributed to internalizing gender roles and the idea that
politics is a men's domain, as exemplified by girls becoming more likely
as they age to draw a man when asked to draw a politician. On the other
hand, more recent peer-reviewed studies by Russo and Stattin (2017) and
Shehata and Amnå (2019) both find a slight increase in political
interest between 13 years old and 15 years old. In the Canadian context,
Dostie-Goulet (2009a) also finds children's political interest falls
between ages 14 and 15, before increasing between 15 and 16 years old.

Around the age of 15, numerous European studies find children start
experiencing an important uptick in political interest, which keeps
increasing until they reach 25 years old approximately, after which it
stabilizes (Neundorf, Smets, and Garcia-Albacete 2013; Prior 2019;
Quintelier and Van Deth 2014; Russo and Stattin 2017; Shehata and Amnå
2019). Russo and Stattin (2017) and Prior (2019) suggest the rise in
political interest among adolescents could be due to an increasingly
clear sense of what politics is during those formative years (15--25),
although it has also been found that by age 10, children have already
gained an understanding of what politics means (Hess and Torney 1967).
Russo and Stattin (2017) put it in these terms:

\begin{quote}
{[}W{]}e observed a general increase in interest in politics, which is
much steeper between 16 and 18 years of age than in the 13--15 age
range. One interpretation of this finding lies in the ideas that --- at
these ages --- adolescents obtain cognitive abilities that allow
abstract thinking and reasoning {[}\ldots{]} and they learn more about
society and the wider world. Another possibility is that youths become
more interested in political issues because they are approaching voting
age, and their `social environment (as parents and teachers) anticipate
a 'life event' in becoming an enfranchised voter' {[}\ldots{]} Even if
our results are consistent with both these ideas, it is worth noting
that there was no national election in Sweden in 2012 (when we collected
data from the 18 year-olds). Hence, cognitive maturation is a more
plausible explanation for the increase in political interest that we
observed between 16 and 18 years of age (654).
\end{quote}

Adolescence and early adulthood are important, as Russo and Stattin
(2017) suggest that it ``is during this period that parents, teachers,
and role models in general can potentially raise youths' interest in
political and societal issues'' (655). Learning when exactly political
interest increases during one's lifetime can help understanding the
political socialization processes at play.

How large is this increase in political interest between 15 and 25 years
old? In panel data collected among British, Swiss and German
respondents, Prior (2019) estimates there is a 10--15 percentage point
increase. Political interest keeps increasing after 25 years old, but at
a slower pace, and almost entirely due to cohort effects: older cohorts
of voters, especially those born in the 1940s, are particularly
interested in politics. However, within each cohort of people, after
reaching 25 years old, political interest remains very stable until
death. Prior's (2019) findings are similar in all three countries
studied.

Political interest also becomes more \emph{stable} at the individual
level over the teenage years. Prior (2019) finds an increase in the
stability of political interest between the ages of 11 and 20. Russo and
Stattin (2017) also show that the stability of political interest
increases drastically from 13 years old to 20 years old, after which it
remains high. Using a 5-category response scale to measure political
interest, they find that 21.8\% of adolescents aged 13--15 changed their
answer by two or more response categories over two years, compared with
only 4.5\% of those aged 26 to 28.

Evolution}\label{gender-differences-in-political-interest-evolution}}

\hypertarget{size-of-the-gender-gap}{%
\subsection{Size of the Gender Gap}\label{size-of-the-gender-gap}}

Among scientific studies on the gender gap in political interest among
children and teenagers, a first group of studies finds that boys already
report higher levels of political interest. Among children aged 7 to 14,
Hess and Torney (1967) find a gender gap varying between two and five
percentage points, with boys being more interested in United States
government and current events. Owen and Dennis (1988) also find that
boys aged 10--13 and 14--17 in the United States are more interested in
politics than girls of that age. More recently, Arens and Watermann
(2017) find a gender gap of 7.4 points for 12-year-old Germans, which
increases to 10.8 points for 15-year-olds, where boys report being more
interested in politics.

However, the findings are not all consistent across studies and
contexts. Dowse and Hughes (1971) find no statistically significant
gender gap (-0.3 to +1.4 percentage point, where positive numbers are
associated with boys) in political interest for children aged 11--17.
Mayer and Schmidt (2004) also find that no strong gender differences in
political interest exist between boys and girls aged 12 to 15 in China,
Mexico, the United States, and Japan. Similar results are found among
Quebec students aged 14 and 15 (Beauregard 2008; Dostie-Goulet 2009a).
However, Bos et al. (2022) find that \emph{girls} are slightly but
significantly (3.3 points) more interested in politics at 6--7 years
old, but then the gap quickly reverses and grows larger until early
adolescence.\footnote{Political interest is measured using
  age-appropriate questions adapted from the Noyce Enthusiasm for
  Science scale. ``Interest in political activities is an index of
  agree/disagree responses to the following sentiments: (1) politics,
  government, and history are exciting topics; (2) curiosity to learn
  about politics, government, and history; (3) desire to have a
  political job; and (4) learning about government is boring {[}reverse
  coded{]}'' (Bos et al. 2022, 488).} By age 12, \emph{boys} are 6.7
points more interested in politics. Overall, US boys are found to be 2.4
points more interested in politics than girls (Bos et al. 2020, 2022).

For older teenagers and young adults, starting at age 15 --- the time
when political interest starts increasing markedly --- the literature is
clearer: studies conducted in various contexts generally show an
important gender gap in self-reported political interest, where men are
the most interested, and the gap is growing through time for those who
report longitudinal data. Using a -100--+100 scale where positive
numbers are associated with men, the gender gap in political interest
has been measured at +2 (Koskimaa and Rapeli (2015), Finland, 16--18
years old and Dostie-Goulet (2009a), Canada, 14--16 years old); +5
(Janmaat, Hoskins, and Pensiero (2022), UK, 16 years old); +11
(Cicognani et al. (2012), Belgium, 15--19 years old and Lawless and Fox
(2013), USA, 18--25 years old); +15 (Burns, Schlozman, and Verba (2001),
United States, 18 years old and Muxel (2002), France, 18--25 years old);
+20 (Fraile and Sánchez-Vítores (2020), UK, 15 years old); +22 (Janmaat,
Hoskins, and Pensiero (2022), UK, 30 years old); +27 (Hyman (1959),
Germany, 15--24 years old); and +30 (Fraile and Sánchez-Vítores (2020),
UK, 25 years old). Among these results, only Koskimaa and Rapeli's
(2015) are not statistically significant.

The increases in the gender gap between late adolescence and early
adulthood reported by the recent studies of Fraile and Sánchez-Vítores
(2020) and Janmaat, Hoskins, and Pensiero (2022) are substantially
large, although both rely on the same panel dataset. Fraile and
Sánchez-Vítores (2020) also test for sub-periods within the 1991--2009
time frame and find similar results.

Among the general adult population, studies also point to a greater
interest in politics by men compared with women. J. Van Deth (2000)
shows a gender gap in political interest in the Netherlands, which has
remained steady or increased through time. Among adults, Prior (2019)
finds that men are 10--15 percentage points more interested in politics
than women, a wider gap than the one found among younger respondents.
Sánchez-Vítores (2019) finds a statistically significant gender gap in
13 countries. Fraile and Sánchez-Vítores (2020) suggest that after the
formative years of 15 to 25 years old, ``attitudes crystallize and so
does the gender gap, remaining at the same size (around 30 percentage
points of difference between women and men) over the life course'' (89).
Using 2002 European Social Survey data, they find a gender gap across 15
European countries, varying between 4 and 13 percentage points.

\hypertarget{gaps-in-interest-for-certain-topics}{%
\subsection{Gaps in Interest for Certain
Topics}\label{gaps-in-interest-for-certain-topics}}

Some studies conducted among teenagers report the types of interests
girls and boys have, but do not always find significant differences
there. Beauregard (2008) finds no gender gap in reported interest in
domestic and international politics. Burns, Schlozman, and Verba (2001)
also find null results with regards to interest in community and social
issues, which contrasts with the gender gap in political interest they
report. Finally, Oswald and Schmid (1998) find that ``girls are more
interested than boys in topics like peace, ecology and problems of the
Third World, whereas boys are more interested in governmental and
international affairs than girls'' (153). The authors reason that girls
might not be ``interested as much in the institutions of politics and in
the everyday business of negotiation in government and parliament and
that the single question measures mainly this sphere of front-page
politics'' (153). All three studies focus on a relatively limited number
of topics.

Among adults, on average, studies have found that women report more
interest in topics such as health care, education and gender issues,
while men report more interest in foreign policy, partisan politics, and
law and order (R. Campbell and Winters 2008; Coffé 2013; Ferrin et al.
2020; Hayes and Bean 1993; Kuhn 2004; Sabella 2004a; Verba, Burns, and
Schlozman 1997). Topics such as taxes and local politics seem to be
equally interesting to men and women.

\hypertarget{political-interest-evolution-in-canada}{%
\subsection{Political Interest Evolution in
Canada}\label{political-interest-evolution-in-canada}}

Political interest has generally been found to be higher in Canada than
in other Western countries. Howe (2010) finds that 59\% of Canadian
citizens report being very or somewhat interested in politics, a higher
percentage than in most European countries. Similarly, using World
Values Survey data, Gidengil et al. (2004) show that Canada ranks fourth
among seventeen democratic countries when it comes to the average level
of political interest.\footnote{The timing of the World Values Survey
  might be a confounding factor since Canadian data was collected
  shortly before the Meech Lake Accord failed --- a time of intense
  political discussion (Howe 2010).} On political interest evolution,
mirroring trends in other Western countries, Canadians aged 21--29 have
long been less interested in politics than those aged 50--65, and this
age gap seems to be growing (Gidengil et al. 2004; Howe 2010). Political
interest also varies by province: ``Residents of Quebec and Saskatchewan
are typically less interested (5.0) in politics in general than
Canadians at large. Meanwhile, interest is highest in British Columbia
(5.8), followed by Manitoba, Ontario, Newfoundland and Labrador (5.7),
and Alberta (5.6)'' (Gidengil et al. 2004, 24).

Gidengil et al. (2004) evaluate the gender gap in political interest
between Canadian women and men to be worth 5 percentage points, which is
a modest gap according to them, although they emphasize this gap is
persistent.

\hypertarget{theorizing-change-over-time}{%
\section{Theorizing Change Over
Time}\label{theorizing-change-over-time}}

It seems worthwhile to study political socialization in the period of
life where political interest is developed --- chuldhood to early
adulthood --- since there seems to be some level of path dependency in
individuals' political interest afterwards. Gender differences also seem
to become starker at that moment: the early increase in self-reported
political interest seems to be stronger for men (Jennings and Niemi
1981, 276), and political socialization seems to be faster-paced during
the teenage years. Fraile and Sánchez-Vítores (2020) suggest that ``the
development of gender roles during early childhood is a crucial phase in
the source of the gender gap, deserving further attention from
scholars'' (89). Moreover, no study has measured the evolution of
interest in various political topics with age among children or adults.

\emph{\textbf{Hypothesis 0a}: Interest in specific political topics
starts rising around age 15 and increases until age 25, after which it
stabilizes.}

\emph{\textbf{Hypothesis 0b}: Gender differences in interest in specific
political topics start rising around age 15 and increase until age 25,
after which they stabilize.}

Given findings among adults that women and men are interested in
different topics depending on these topics being assertion-focused or
cooperation-focused (see Chapter~\ref{sec-chap1}), Hypotheses 0c and 0d
provide two alternative views about when these differences should start
to occur. Hypothesis 0c suggests such differences in interest exist
prior to the increase in self-reported political interest around age 15,
perhaps as a result of tendencies towards agency and communality which
start developing early.\footnote{Gender differences in assertive speech
  use may develop between 1 and 2 years old, as Fagot et al. (1985)
  suggest, or may not have already developed at that age, as Brownell,
  Ramani, and Zerwas (2006) suggest. A meta-analysis of studies done by
  Leaper and Smith (2004) including children from various age groups
  more generally finds that boys use more assertive speech than girls,
  although this is not the case in mixed-gender interactions. Noakes and
  Rinaldi (2006) also find that, among boys and girls aged 9--14, boys
  reported having more interpersonal disagreements related to status and
  hierarchy, and girls were more likely to use cooperative conflict
  resolution strategies. Finally, Caravita and Cillessen (2012) find
  that, among 9--15-year-old girls and boys, boys appear to have more
  agentic goals and girls appear to have more communal goals, although
  aging makes the gender gap in agency appear and the gap in communality
  disappear, which could be due to a relatively small sample size.}
Hypothesis 0d instead suggests that --- likely as a result of cognitive
maturation --- personality traits only start fostering interest in
assertion-focused or cooperation-focused political topics between ages
15 and 25.

\emph{\textbf{Hypothesis 0c}: Gender differences in interest in specific
political topics already exist prior to age 15, with boys already more
interested in assertion-focused political topics such as law and crime,
international affairs and partisan politics, and girls more interested
in cooperation-focused political topics such as health care and
education politics at 10--15 years old.}

\emph{\textbf{Hypothesis 0d}: Between ages 15 and 25, boys develop more
interest in assertion-focused political topics, while girls develop more
interest in cooperation-focused political topics. These differences then
carry on at the adult age.}

Hypothesis 0a, 0b and 0c should apply to interest in the five topics
used throughout this book: health care, education, partisan politics,
law and crime, and international affairs. Since past studies have found
the self-reported measure of political interest is mostly associated
with interest in partisan politics (R. Campbell and Winters 2008), it
should be treated as an assertion-focused political topic.

Hypothesis 0e suggests, again as a result of the cognitive maturation
theory laid out by Russo and Stattin (2017), that issues related to
partisan politics --- such as elections and parties --- are more
political than other not explicitly partisan issues such as the working
conditions of nurses or tuition fees. This would be congruent with
Hypothesis 0d.

\emph{\textbf{Hypothesis 0e}: Boys and girls both see issues related to
partisan politics as more political than other political issues starting
at age 15.}

Studies have found strong causal or correlational associations between
political interest, political knowledge, political efficacy, and other
indicators of political engagement (Bennett and Bennett 1989; Coffé and
Bolzendahl 2010; Coffé 2013; Ondercin and Jones-White 2011; Prior 2019)
--- who are sometimes bundled together to create general political
engagement scales. Therefore, Hypotheses 0f and 0g suggest that the
value of these indicators tend to covary by age, and that gender
differences in these indicators should also emerge within similar time
frames.

\emph{\textbf{Hypothesis 0f}: Various indicators of political
engagement, such as political interest, political knowledge and
political efficacy, mostly increase at the same time --- ages 15--25.}

\emph{\textbf{Hypothesis 0g}: Gender differences in various indicators
of political engagement, such as political interest, political knowledge
and political efficacy, when they exist, mostly arise at the same time
--- ages 15--25.}

\hypertarget{data-and-methods}{%
\section{Data and Methods}\label{data-and-methods}}

This chapter wants to portray the evolution of political interest by age
and through time, and therefore relies on five datasets across several
survey years: the Canadian Children Political Interest Survey (CCPIS),
the Datagotchi Post-Election Survey (Datagotchi PES), the Canadian
Election Study (CES), the World Values Survey (WVS) and the Canadian
General Social Survey (GSS). The CCPIS includes survey data collected
among 8-to-18--year-olds in 2022, while the Datagotchi PES includes data
collected among Quebec adults in 2023. More about these datasets is
explained in Chapter~\ref{sec-chap2}. Both the CCPIS and Datagotchi PES
include questions about interests in specific political topics, which
can better measure the concept. While the CES, WVS and GSS do not ask
these specific political topics, they each have unique advantages. The
CES includes the most survey years --- with a question on political
interest being asked in surveys from 1997 to 2021 --- makes it possible
to measure other indicators of political engagement than political
interest, including political knowledge, efficacy, and participation.
The WVS makes it possible to compare Canadians' level of interest with
other countries. Finally, two GSS surveys --- 2013 and 2020 --- provide
the largest datasets and, since it is not designed as a political survey
per survey, may provide more accurate measures of Canadians' level of
interest in politics --- despite the limitations of a single-item
measure.

\subsection{The Evolution of Self-Reported Political Interest Among
Adults}\label{the-evolution-of-self-reported-political-interest-among-adults}}

In order to explore what level of general (self-reported) political
interest Canadian men and women report, three datasets are mobilized:
the 2021 CES, the WVS's Wave 7 (2017--22) and the 2020 GSS.
Figure~\ref{fig-yeargender} shows the evolution in Canadians' average
level of political interest by gender from 1990 to 2021. In general, CES
respondents are the most interested in politics according to these data
--- 6.3/10 --- which is unsurprising given these surveys are conducted
during election campaigns, and ask questions of a more clearly political
nature. WVS respondents are the least interested --- 4.5/10 --- with GSS
respondents sitting somewhere in between --- 5.8/10. Between-survey
differences are therefore twice as large as gender differences in
political interest. In general, political interest seems to have
increased between 2000 and 2021, with an average interest of 4.9/10 in
the 2000 CES and WVS and an average interest of 6.1/10 in the 2019--20
CES, WVS and GSS.

\newline \textit{Notes}: On the \textit{y} axis, 0 = no interest at all,
and 10 = a great deal of interest. CES and WVS weights are applied.}

\end{figure}

Despite fluctuations in the level of political interest between surveys
\emph{and} within surveys taken at different times, the gender gap in
self-reported political interest remains relatively constant through
time, with a notable exception in the 2021 CES, where a sharp drop in
women's political interest occurs while men's political interest remains
largely stable, bringing the largest gender gap of these studies ---
1.3/10 points. The size of the gender gap slightly varies between
studies, standing on average at 0.6 points in the GSS, 0.7 points in the
CES and 0.9 points in the WVS. In every survey and every year, men are
significantly more likely to report being interested in politics.

Again relying on data from the CES, WVS and GSS,
Figure~\ref{fig-timeceswvsgss} shows average self-reported political
interest by age and gender among Canadians, using a local regression
model (LOESS). The trends among all three surveys are very similar and
match to some degree with cross-country WVS results as well.

average interest by age and gender. CES, WVS and GSS weights are

\end{figure}

In all three datasets, interest in politics increases as people age, but
it does so relatively slowly from 18 to 50 years old --- or not at all,
according to CES data. A large gender gap also appears for those within
that age group in all three datasets. For instance, CES data shows that
on average, women aged 18 to 50 report being neither interested nor
disinterested in politics --- 5/10; men, on the other hand, report being
somewhat interested in politics --- 6.5/10. This 1.5-point gap is
statistically significant (\emph{p}\textless0.001).

After age 50, both men and women start reporting higher levels of
interest in politics, and this interest keeps increasing through their
60s, 70s, 80s and 90s. Moreover, again starting at age 50, the gender
gap progressively reduces, as women's political interest increases more
quickly than men's. Around age 75--80, the gap becomes statistically
non-significant, although confidence intervals also become wider due to
smaller sample sizes. For instance, in their early 90s, CES data shows
that the average interest in politics stands at 8/10 for both men and
women. Overall, throughout people's life course, CES data shows that
women's political interest averages 5.4, while men's averages 6.8
(\emph{p}\textless0.001).

How does Canada compare with other countries? Across all 57 countries
surveyed during wave 7 of the WVS, the average political interest was
4.8/10 for men and 4/10 for women (\emph{p}\textless0.001), and while
political interest increased with people's age, the size of the gender
gap remained relatively similar with age. Among Canadian WVS
respondents, the average political interest was 6.2/10 for men and 5/10
for women: this gender gap is 0.35 points \emph{larger} than the WVS
average and is statistically significant (\emph{p}\textless0.001).
Moreover, the age pattern was somewhat different in the Canadian WVS
compared with the WVS's cross-country results, becoming statistically
insignificant around age 75. Despite smaller sample sizes for people
aged 75 and over in all surveys, all of them show a shrinking of the gap
at that age in Canada, which reinforces confidence in that finding.

Within Canada, across all three studies, average political interest was
higher in larger provinces, with an average of 6.1/10 in Alberta, 6/10
in Quebec and Ontario, and 5.9/10 in British Columbia. New Brunswick
stood last at 5.5/10. Between-study differences were large, suggesting
these results need to be interpreted with caution.

Figure~\ref{fig-cesgapyearage} looks at the size of the gender gap by
age for each CES, making it possible to assess the presence of
generational effects. Positive values indicate women report being more
interested, while negative values indicate men report being more
interested. The 2021 CES stands out as having the largest gender gap in
political interest on average between 20 and 80 years old. All other
election studies are associated with similar trends in the evolution of
the gender gap with age: the gap slowly reduces with time. Values tend
to diverge more importantly among older and younger voters, as a result
of smaller sample sizes at the extremes of the age distribution. When
respondents aged 18--20 and those aged 85 and over are removed from the
sample, differences between surveys become smaller.

\begin{figure}

\caption{\label{fig-cesgapyearage}General Political Interest by Year and

\textit{y} axis, 0 = no gender difference in interest at all, positive
values (up to +10) = women more interested, negative values (down to
-10) = men more interested.}

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig-timepoliticalengagement} shows the level of political
engagement among 2021 CES respondents. Levels of external political
efficacy and political participation remain low and stable for
respondents aged 18 to 90, and no statistically significant gender gap
is found. Conversely, large 20-point gaps in internal political efficacy
and knowledge of political figures' names are found. These gaps become
smaller as respondents' age increases.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{_graphs/TimePoliticalEngagement.pdf}

\caption{\label{fig-timepoliticalengagement}Level of Political

\newline \textit{Notes}: On the \textit{y} axis, 0 = no engagement at
all, and 10 = a great deal of engagement. Dots represent average
interest by age and gender. CES weights are applied.}

\end{figure}

Some of these trends mirror quite closely what is found for political
interest among these same CES respondents. Notably, large gender gaps in
knowledge of political figures' names and internal political efficacy
appear among younger respondents. These gaps are larger than the
13-point gap in political interest. Similar to political interest, these
gaps also seem to progressively fade among older respondents, and after
age 80--85, the level of political interest seems to be the same for
women and men. With regards to knowledge, the gap was to be expected and
mirrors findings from past research (notably Stolle and Gidengil
(2010)), as recalling the names of political figures is closely tied to
partisan politics and assertion as opposed to cooperation.

Figure~\ref{fig-yearethnicityceswvs} looks at the gender differences
through an intersectional lens, with gender--ethnicity pairs and
gender--immigrant status pairs included across several survey-years for
which the information was available. While this chapter focuses on the
gender gap in self-reported political interest, different groups of
women also differ in political interest.\footnote{For instance, in the
  Dominican Republic, Spierings (2012) found that Protestant women
  report levels of political interest similar to men and higher than
  Catholic women, while Mestizo women report lower levels of political
  interest than Indigenous women.}

\subsection{Canadian Children Political Interest
Survey}\label{canadian-children-political-interest-survey}}

What kinds of political topics are children and adolescents interested
in? Are there gender differences in how interested they are in these
topics? Does gender predict political interest in itself, or is it only
a proxy for other variables? Data from the Canadian Children Political
Interest Survey (CCPIS), described in further detail in
Chapter~\ref{sec-chap2}, is used to answer these questions.
\ref{tab:lmeInterestCCPIS} shows the link between gender and interest in
each of the topics among elementary and high school students. The upper
part includes gender as the only predictor, while the lower part
includes controls for socio-demographic variables and personality
traits.\footnote{Figure~\ref{fig-interestccpis} in
  Appendix~\ref{sec-appendix4} shows the gender coefficient for two
  intermediate models, one with SES controls and one with SES and
  personality traits but no interactions. Before adding interactions
  between (i) gender and age, (ii) gender and ethnicity, and (iii) age
  squared, coefficients from the simple regression model remain
  significant.}

In the upper half of the table, taking into account classroom fixed
effects, boys generally report being more interested in politics than
girls, but the gender gap is relatively minimal, standing at 0.43 for
the 11-point political interest scale (\emph{p}\textless0.05). Boys'
interest in international affairs and partisan politics is higher than
girls' (1-point and 0.85-point difference respectively; both
\emph{p}\textless0.001). This seems to be in line with the results among
adult respondents. However, girls' interest in law and crime is also
slightly higher (0.5 point, \emph{p}\textless0.05). This result is more
surprising given previous literature showing the contrary. Results for
the other two topics, health care and education, are almost even between
the genders, and not statistically significant, despite adult women
usually reporting higher levels of interest in these two topics across
studies.

However, in the lower half of the table, controlling for
socio-demographic factors, all relationships between gender and interest
disappear. It might be the case that girls are less interested in some
of these topics by virtue of other socio-demographic characteristics,
but there does not seem to be one other socio-demographic variable that
reliably predicts interest in any of the topics. These multiple
regression results might be tainted by some multicollinearity between
ethnicity, immigrant status and language.

Figure~\ref{fig-interestyoungold} re-analyzes those results for children
aged 10--14 (\emph{n}=200) and those aged 15--18 (\emph{n}=446). Among
younger students, the gender gap in self-reported political interest is
0.06/10 (not statistically significant). Among those aged 15--18, this
gap grows to 0.53/10 (\emph{p}\textless0.05). Notably, among both
groups, both interest in international affairs and interest in partisan
politics are higher among boys than girls, suggesting some gender
differences in interests might take place before adolescence.

Specific Political Topics by Age Group Among Canadian Children, 2022

\end{figure}

For health care and education, results among Canadian children --- which
show no gender gap --- might come as a surprise given the number of
studies that show adult women report being more interested in the
political aspects of these topics in various contexts. Still, the
experiences of several women as mothers and caregivers later in life
might be the elements that shape the importance they give to both
issues.

Figure~\ref{fig-political} shows how students view each of the 10
concrete issues associated with the 5 topics as political or
non-political. As expected, the two issues related to partisan politics
are almost universally seen as political, followed by issues related to
international affairs. These are the two topics for which boys report
being more interested. Findings for issues related to the other three
topics are perceived by 25\% to 60\% of students as being non-political
--- substantially large proportions. R. Campbell and Winters (2008) and
Ferrin et al. (2020) had similarly found that issues related to partisan
politics were seen as more political than those related to other topics.
Visibly, this trend also applies to Canadian children, which suggests
that topics which are seen as political are also those for which men
typically report a higher degree of interest.

\hypertarget{datagotchi-pes}{%
\subsection{Datagotchi PES}\label{datagotchi-pes}}

How do these interests change when people reach adulthood? This question
is best answered using Datagotchi PES data. As \ref{tab:olsInterestDg}
shows, Quebec men generally report being more interested in politics
than women. Men's interest in international affairs and partisan
politics is also higher than women's (0.7-point and 0.6-point difference
respectively; both \emph{p}\textless0.001). Men's interest in law and
order is also slightly higher (0.2 point, \emph{p}\textless0.1).
However, women are significantly more interested in health care and
education (0.7-point and 0.5-point difference respectively, both
\emph{p}\textless0.001) than men are.\footnote{Figure~\ref{fig-interestdg}
  in Appendix~\ref{sec-appendix4} shows the gender coefficient for an
  intermediate model with SES controls but no interactions. Before
  adding interactions between (i) gender and age, (ii) gender and
  ethnicity, and (iii) age squared, coefficients from the simple
  regression model remain significant.}

Figure~\ref{fig-datagotchi} inquires about any time trends in the
evolution of interest in each of the topics, including gendered aspects.
No clear gender pattern emerges, beyond the finding that the gap in
general political interest becomes statistically insignificant among
Quebeckers aged 75 and over.

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}}

This chapter highlights gender differences in interest in various
political topics, but also shows differences between children and
adults. For international relations and partisan politics, male students
report more interest in these topics, just like adults in previous
studies. However, girls' higher interest in law and crime and similar
levels of interest in health care and education compared to boys
contrast with data previously found among adults (R. Campbell and
Winters 2008; Coffé 2013; Ferrin et al. 2020; Hayes and Bean 1993; Kuhn
2004; Sabella 2004a; Verba, Burns, and Schlozman 1997). Given the
results of the Datagotchi PES, which shows higher levels of interest in
the political aspects of health care and education among adult women
than men, it seems that the gender gap in interest in these topics
emerges in early adulthood, perhaps as a result of life events that
happen at that stage, such as women becoming more likely to care for
children and relatives. Given the absence of longitudinal data collected
among Canadians, it is not possible to tell at what point in time girls
or women become more interested in health care and education issues
relative to men. However, given the current results of two datasets, it
is possible to note, for the first time, that some differences in
interests are not necessarily pre-existent among adolescents. On the
other hand, reported interest in politics in general, partisan politics
and international affairs is already higher among boys aged 10 to 18.

Russo and Stattin (2017) suggested that the 13--15 age range is a period
when parents, teachers, and other role models have the highest potential
for transmission of interest in politics to children. Applying these
results to the Canadian context, it appears that the 15--25-year-old
period, similar to what previous studies have found, is also the point
in time where a gender gap in interest for politics more generally
emerges, with boys/men reporting higher interest in politics in general
than girls/women.

\chapter{Parent--Child Political Interest Transmission: Do Moms
Influence their Daughters and Dads Influence their
Sons?}\label{sec-chap4}}

Parents play a prominent role in raising their children and therefore
are among the main actors who can transmit political interest to them.
Political scientists have long studied the extent of parents' role in
that regard and the mechanisms through which political interest can be
transmitted. A. Campbell et al. (1960) already suggested that ``interest
in politics, like partisanship, is readily transmitted within the family
from generation to generation'' (413). More recent research has
highlighted inequalities in the extent to which boys and girls match
their parents' level of political interest. This chapter aims to uncover
the complex role gender can play in mediating parent--child political
interest transmission. When and how does political interest transmission
occur? To what extent do mothers influence political interest
development in their children? Do they have a greater influence on their
sons or daughters? What about fathers? Do these results hold for
different political topics, when political interest is measured by
sector? The chapter relies on social learning theory and seeks to test
this dissertation's first hypothesis highlighted in
Chapter~\ref{sec-chap1}: \emph{Children's interest in specific political
topics is more related to political discussions with their same-gender
parent(s) than other-gender parent(s).}

\hypertarget{political-interest-transmission}{%
\section{Political Interest
Transmission}\label{political-interest-transmission}}

The transmission of interest in politics between parents and children
has typically been measured by using methods to statistically compare
their answers to the same political interest questions. Studies have
generally shown a significant relationship between parents' political
interest and their children's political interest (Beauregard 2008;
Janmaat, Hoskins, and Pensiero 2022; Neundorf, Smets, and
Garcia-Albacete 2013; Prior 2019; Shehata and Amnå 2019). While
Jennings, Stoker, and Bowers (2009) find no statistically significant
relationship, their results show that successful parent--child political
interest transmission occurs when the family environment is more
politicized. Prior (2019) estimates moderately strong Pearson
correlation coefficients of 0.3 to 0.4 for parent--child political
interest scores across three countries. By comparison, correlation
coefficients of different indicators of political interest for the same
individual vary between 0.6 and 0.7.

Parent--child political interest correlations vary by age. Prior (2019)
finds very weak (0.05) correlations at age 11, followed by a steady
growth until age 15. Parent--child correlations then remain stronger
when both parents share a similar level of political interest, when this
parental political interest is stable through time, and when children
move out late from their parents' place. Children who move out early of
their parents' place tend to see a quick drop in the extent to which
their political interest matches their parents'. Janmaat, Hoskins, and
Pensiero (2022) also find that, between ages 11 and 15, the gap in
political interest between children whose parents are not interested in
politics and children whose parents are interested in politics grows
every year. Shehata and Amnå (2019), for their part, find the strength
of the relationship between parents' news media use and children's
political interest remains stable between ages 13 and 18.

While parents' political interest often seems to match their children's
political interest, most studies lack the kind of data needed to
establish a causal link between both. However, Prior (2019) uses panel
data collected among parents and children and finds a weak but
noticeable causal link in parental transmission of political interest.
In time series, an increase in mothers' political interest is often
accompanied by an increase in their children's political interest. The
same goes for fathers, and for decreases rather than increases. These
trends are clearer in the United Kingdom and Germany, despite weaker
evidence in Switzerland. In the first two countries, it seems reasonable
to assume that a change in parents' political interest could cause a
similar change in their children's political interest.

The main causal mechanism for this transmission process seems to be
parent--child political discussions. Scholars have long suggested that
the development of political interest can happens through increasingly
complex discussions about political topics between parents and children
at home (D. Easton, Dennis, and Easton 1969; Greenstein 1965). These
discussions can be initiated either by the parent or by the child, and
the more they occur, the likelier the child is to be interested in
politics. This relationship between the frequency of political
discussions with parents and the child's interest in politics is
statistically significant in the United States (Shehata and Amnå 2019),
China, Mexico, Japan (Mayer and Schmidt 2004), and Canada (Dostie-Goulet
2009b). Furthermore, Shehata and Amnå (2019) find that changes in the
frequency of political discussions with parents positively predict
changes in adolescents' level of political interest.

It is also important to recognize that children can play a role in
shaping political discussions with their parents --- and potentially
their parents' interest in politics. McDevitt and Chaffee (2002) find
evidence of trickle-up political socialization, in which adolescent
children initiate political discussions with parents, who react by
increasing their news consumption or finding other ways to gain
knowledge about politics in order to maintain a leadership role in the
family. In this study, children's interest is first triggered through a
civics curriculum.\footnote{The influence of schools, teachers, and
  citizenship education are studied in more detail in
  Chapter~\ref{sec-chap6}.} York (2019) even finds that adolescents'
news use and political discussions with peers have a positive influence
on their political discussions with parents, while the opposite effects
--- political discussions with parents influencing adolescents' news use
or political discussions with peers --- are not found to hold.

Yet, other studies about the relative influence of various socialization
agents on the development of political interest in children and
adolescents (Dostie-Goulet 2009b; Koskimaa and Rapeli 2015; Shehata and
Amnå 2019) mostly find that parents play a larger role in transmitting
political interest than any other socialization agent --- including
friends, media and schools. Trickle-down political socialization ---
from parents to children --- therefore remains an important explanation
of children's development of political interest.

\hypertarget{gender-differences-in-transmission}{%
\section{Gender Differences in
Transmission}\label{gender-differences-in-transmission}}

Research has found that the trickle-down effect of political interest
from parents to children works in gendered ways, and much of that
evidence suggests transmission works better for parent--child pairs of
the same gender. From the perspective of parents, mothers' political
interest has a stronger effect on their daughters than sons' political
interest, while fathers' political interest has a stronger effect on
their sons' political interest (Beauregard 2008; Owen and Dennis 1988;
Prior 2019). Disregarding parents' gender, Sabella (2004b) finds that
parents' potential to transmit political interest to their sons is
stronger than to their daughters. From the perspective of children,
daughters' political interest seems to be influenced mostly by their
mothers, with the mother--daughter political interest link stronger than
all other combinations (Beauregard 2008; Owen and Dennis 1988; Prior
2019), although Rebenstorf (2004) strikes a discordant note, finding
that fathers' potential to transmit political interest to their children
is stronger than mothers'. Finally, it is not clear whether sons'
political interest is influenced mostly by their father (Beauregard
2008; Owen and Dennis 1988) or mother (Prior 2019).

The strength of parent--child political interest correlations by gender
is inquired by Prior (2019), whose findings are more recent and rely on
panel data. In the British dataset, they find mother--daughter political
interest correlations are the strongest (0.43), while mother--son,
father--daughter and father--son correlations all sit between 0.31 and
0.34. In their German dataset, all four pairs are relatively close
together, but exact numbers are not provided by the author. Finally, in
the Swiss dataset, mother--daughter correlations are the strongest
(0.36), followed by mother--son (0.31), father--son (0.21) and
father--daughter (0.2). There is overall a stronger causal effect of
mothers' political interest on their children's political interest,
compared with fathers.\footnote{Kestilä-Kekkonen et al. (2023) also find
  stronger effects of mothers on children when it comes to the
  transmission of political self-efficacy, but do not not find a
  stronger relationship between parents and children of the same gender.}

Studies have investigated the gender patterns in parent--child political
discussions, but the amount of political discussions does not seem to
vary based on parents' and children's gender. While earlier studies
found that children discuss politics more often with their fathers than
mothers (Noller and Bagi 1985; Oswald and Schmid 1998), more recent
research has found no significant difference between fathers and mothers
(Hooghe and Boonen 2015; Mayer and Schmidt 2004; Shulman and DeAndrea
2014). Noller and Bagi (1985) also find that parents discuss politics
more often with their sons. However, most studies again find a different
pattern in which parents discuss politics with their daughters as much
as with their sons (Dowse and Hughes 1971; Lawless and Fox 2015; Mayer
and Schmidt 2004). Overall, it seems reasonable to assume, as Hooghe and
Boonen (2015) do, that political discussions involving the father tend
to revolve mostly around partisan politics, while political discussions
with mothers might center on other topics --- presumably health care,
education, gender issues, and so on.

The nature of discussions about politics could also vary by gender, with
more conflictual discussions happening between sons and fathers, or
between mothers and daughters, than between other-gender pairs.
Vuchinich (1987) shows the opposite to be true: parents are more likely
to begin conflictual interactions with their other-gender children than
same-gender children, while children initiate conflictual interactions
with their mother more than with their father. It is not clear whether
these patterns also apply to political discussions.

While past studies have found no differences in the frequency of
political discussions by child gender or parent gender, these studies
have not studied whether the specific topics of political discussions in
the family could vary by parent gender or child gender. Are fathers more
likely than mothers to discuss agency-related political topics with
their children? Are parents more likely to discuss communality-related
political topics with their daughters than sons? Hypotheses 1a--1f
provide hypotheses about the frequency of political discussions by
gender in the family unit.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{\textbf{Hypothesis 1a}: Mothers are as likely as fathers to
  discuss any specific political topic with their children.}
\item
  \emph{\textbf{Hypothesis 1b}: Mothers are more likely than fathers to
  discuss the politics of health care and education with their
  children.}
\item
  \emph{\textbf{Hypothesis 1c}: Fathers are more likely than mothers to
  discuss law and crime, international affairs, and partisan politics
  with their children.}
\item
  \emph{\textbf{Hypothesis 1d}: Parents are as likely to discuss any
  specific political topic with their sons as with their daughters.}
\item
  \emph{\textbf{Hypothesis 1e}: Parents are more likely to discuss the
  politics of health care and education with their daughters than sons.}
\item
  \emph{\textbf{Hypothesis 1f}: Parents are more likely to discuss law
  and crime, international affairs, and partisan politics with their
  sons than daughters.}
\end{itemize}

Hypotheses 1a, 1b and 1c focus their attention on discrepancies between
mothers' and fathers' likelihood of discussing certain topics with their
children, while hypotheses 1d, 1e and 1f focus their attention on
discrepancies between daughters and sons in their likelihood of
discussing politics with --- or being told about politics by --- their
parents. Hypotheses 1a and 1d seek to corroborate previous findings by
Mayer and Schmidt (2004) and others that political discussion frequency
in the family does not vary by gender. To the contrary, hypotheses 1b
and 1e suggest that parent gender is a significant factor that explains
which topics will be discussed with children, and hypotheses 1c and 1f
suggest that child gender is a key variable that explains which topics
they will discuss with their parents.

Parents' education can also affect their children's interest in
politics. Status transmission theory suggests that ``well-educated
parents are more likely to provide a politically stimulating home
environment'' and therefore have politically engaged children (Gidengil,
Wass, and Valaste 2016, 373). It is not clear if status transmission
theory works in gendered ways. Beauregard (2008) and Janmaat, Hoskins,
and Pensiero (2022) find that parents' education has a positive
relationship with their adolescents' political interest regardless of
parents' gender, while other studies find a stronger effect of one
parent. Neundorf, Smets, and Garcia-Albacete (2013) and Koskimaa and
Rapeli (2015) find a positive relationship between fathers' education
and children's interest in politics, Sanjuan and Mantas (2022) instead
find a positive relationship for mothers, Jennings, Stoker, and Bowers
(2009) find no relationship for both fathers and mothers, and Koskimaa
and Rapeli (2015) even find a \emph{negative} relationship between
mothers' education and children's political interest.

Other parental characteristics can also influence the development of
children's political interest in gendered or non-gendered ways.
Gidengil, O'Neill, and Young (2010) and Cicognani et al. (2012) find
that a mother's level of political participation has a positive link
with her daughter's political interest. Jennings, Stoker, and Bowers
(2009) do not find a relationship between parents' income and children's
political interest, but Neundorf, Smets, and Garcia-Albacete (2013) find
a positive relationship between fathers' income and children's political
interest, which they suggest may be due to an indirect process in which
fathers' income increases children's level of education and development
of higher class civic attitudes, which then increases their level of
interest in politics. Borkowska and Luthra (2022) find that political
interest transmission patterns vary between immigrant and non-immigrant
families, with intergenerational transmission somewhat weaker in
immigrant families than other families, notably because other factors
--- such as socialization in a good-performing democracy or not --- have
a more significant influence. The authors find no moderating effect for
naturalization.

\hypertarget{social-learning-theory-1}{%
\section{Social Learning Theory}\label{social-learning-theory-1}}

As highlighted in Chapter~\ref{sec-chap1}, social learning theory
suggests that children learn by observing their parents' behaviour,
attitudes, habits and values, and model their own behaviour, attitudes,
habits and values after them (Gidengil, Wass, and Valaste 2016; Shehata
and Amnå 2019). This process applies to the transmission of political
interest (Jennings, Stoker, and Bowers 2009; Prior 2019; Shehata and
Amnå 2019). Prior (2019) suggests the transmission process starts in
early adolescence, when children still live in the family home but start
acquiring an understanding of what politics is. Its effectiveness is
higher when parents give consistent and strong cues about their own
level of political interest (Jennings, Stoker, and Bowers 2009; Prior
2019). Parents' political opinions and leanings are also more likely to
be known by their children when the family environment is politicized,
since this environment can foster social learning (Jennings, Stoker, and
Bowers 2009; Neundorf, Smets, and Garcia-Albacete 2013). In a political
home environment, children can either feel social pressure to become
interested in politics to create or maintain a sense of social belonging
in the family unit, be exposed to more news media content, listen to or
participate in more political discussions at home, or all of these
(Shehata and Amnå 2019). Bandura (1969) further explains that
observer--model similarity leads children to model their behaviour,
values, attitudes and habits on models that resemble them, notably their
parent(s) of the same gender.

Social learning theory and observer--model similarity both assume that
political interest should be more strongly correlated between mothers
and daughters and between fathers and sons than any other combination.
While this assumption has somewhat effectively been tested in past
research, mothers seem to have an overall stronger influence on the
development of political interest in their children. Moreover, it
remains unclear if this finding applies similarly across various
political topics, or if the cooperation-oriented topics in which women
typically report being more interested --- health care and education ---
can better be transmitted by mothers while those assertion-focused
topics in which men typically report being more interested --- law and
crime, international affairs, and partisan politics --- can better be
transmitted by fathers. Four hypotheses are therefore tested alongside
each other:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{\textbf{Hypothesis 1g}: Children's interest in specific
  political topics is more affected by political discussions with their
  same-gender parent(s) than other-gender parent(s).}
\item
  \emph{\textbf{Hypothesis 1h}: Children's interest in the politics of
  health care and education is more affected by political discussions
  with their mother(s) than father(s).}
\item
  \emph{\textbf{Hypothesis 1i}: Children's interest in law and crime,
  international affairs, and partisan politics is more affected by
  political discussions with their father(s) than mother(s).}
\item
  \emph{\textbf{Hypothesis 1j}: Children's interest in specific
  political topics is more affected by political discussions with their
  mother(s) than father(s).}
\end{itemize}

According to Hypothesis 1g, which is the one most consistent with social
learning theory, a parent's interest in a specific political topic
should influence interest in that topic more strongly for their
same-gender children than other-gender children. On average, a mother is
expected to have more transmission potential of her interest in health
care issues to her daughters than sons through political discussion, for
example. Given the importance of parents' role in socialization in
childhood and adolescence, this transmission process would explain part
of the gender gap in interest into topics such as health care and
partisan politics that exists among adults.

While Hypothesis 1g supposes similar effects of parental discussions for
different topics and suggests the key factor explaining interest
transmission is parent--child gender congruence, the other three
hypotheses provide different answers to the question of how political
interest gender gaps could be transmitted by parents. Hypotheses 1h and
1i suppose the key factor explaining interest transmission is the nature
of the topics themselves --- with mothers having more transmission
potential of interest in topics for which the average woman reports more
interest, and the same for fathers and men's political interests.
Finally, hypothesis 1j supposes that mothers have more transmission
potential than fathers for all topics. Hypotheses 1g and 1j provide
further tests of the findings of Beauregard (2008), Owen and Dennis
(1988), and Prior (2019), while hypotheses 1h and 1i are alternate
hypotheses. Since R. Campbell and Winters (2008) suggest that women tend
to see political issues through the lens of cooperation while men tend
to see them through a lens of self-assertion, hypotheses 1c and 1d test
the suggestion that parental socialization of boys favours
agency-related political topics while parental socialization of girls
favours communality-related political topics.

\hypertarget{time-trends}{%
\section{Time Trends}\label{time-trends}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{\textbf{Hypothesis 1k}: Children's interest in specific
  political topics becomes more and more affected by political
  discussions with their parent(s) between ages 11 and 15, after which
  the parental effects stabilize.}
\end{itemize}

Finally, Hypothesis 1k tests the time trends in parental influence over
children's political interest, testing results but forward by Janmaat,
Hoskins, and Pensiero (2022), Prior (2019) and Shehata and Amnå (2019),
but relying on measures of parent--child political discussions rather
than parental political interest. The hypothesis implies that social
learning and observer--model similarity keep affecting children more and
more as they age, with girls developing more interest in issues they
discuss with their mothers and boys developing more interest in issues
they discuss with their fathers. For the sake of simplicity, the effect
is presumed to be more or less constant across political topics and
across all parent--child pairs --- mother--son, mother--daughter,
father--son, father--daughter.

\hypertarget{data-analysis-1}{%
\section{Data Analysis}\label{data-analysis-1}}

The 2022--23 Canadian Children Political Interest Survey (CCPIS) is used
to study relationships between students' interest in certain topics and
parents' discussions of these same topics. This web-collected bilingual
dataset includes survey responses from 698 Canadian children and
adolescents aged 8 to 18.

The CCPIS includes information about students' interest in various
political topics, the political topics they say they discuss with their
mothers, fathers and peers, as well as the political topics discussed by
a teacher and an influencer they like. The gender of these role models
is also inquired, to test the implication from social learning theory
that political interest transmission should occur mainly between a child
and role models of their gender, more than role models of other genders
(Prior 2019; Shehata and Amnå 2019).

For questions about students' political interests, the following
questions are asked: ``How interested are you in politics generally? Set
the slider to a number from 0 to 10, where 0 means no interest at all,
and 10 means a great deal of interest'', and ``If you were to open a
news website and see the following articles how interested would you be
in reading each article? Set the slider to a number from 0 to 10, where
0 means `Not at all interested, I would not read it,' and 10 means `Very
interested, I would most likely read it.' (a) Health care (i.e.,
pandemic restrictions, working conditions of nurses); (b) International
affairs (i.e., diplomatic disputes between Canada and China, Ukrainian
war); (c) Law and crime (i.e., police funding, sentences for violent
crimes); (d) Education (i.e., university tuition, funding of public and
private schools); (e) Partisan politics (i.e., federal elections,
political parties)''. These questions specify concrete examples of
political issues related to each topic, in order to make the political
aspects of these topics more salient and avoid students answering while
thinking about their own health or classes they are taking. The
question's phrasing is meant to be easily understood by children and
teenagers.

The main socialization-related explanatory variables for children's
political interest identified in the literature concern the role of four
agents of socialization: parents, peers, schools, and media. In order to
determine the importance of parents depending on their gender, the
following questions were asked to children: ``Which parent do you
discuss most often with? (a) Mother; (b) Father; (c) Both equally''.
Several questions are then used to assess the role of parents in
transmitting interest to their children. Given the important role of
political discussion in the transmission of political interest, this
variable is used to measure parents' transmission potential: ``For each
of the following topics, which parent do you discuss most often with?''
Answers are either ``My mother'', ``My father'' or ``Don't know/Prefer
not to answer''.\footnote{Students who do not have one parent of either
  gender are removed from the analysis.} Second, students are asked
``Among these five topics, which one do you discuss most often with your
mother(s)?'' Each of the five topics is listed, and the same question is
then asked for the father(s). While topics such as health care and
education can be spoken about without referring to their political
aspects, children were given examples of political issues related to
each of this topic shortly before in the same survey when they were
asked which topic they were most interested in (e.g., ``Health care
(i.e., pandemic restrictions, working conditions of nurses)'',
``Education (i.e., university tuition, funding of public and private
schools)''). Nevertheless, since these specifications are not repeated
in the subsequent questions inquiring about discussion topics with their
parents, children may have answered while keeping the non-political
aspects of these topics in mind (e.g., ``How was school today? Are you
feeling sick?''), and results are therefore interpreted with caution for
these two topics.

All multilevel regression results presented in this chapter include
controls for socio-economic status, agency, communality, and classroom
fixed effects, except if otherwise specified. A simple multilevel
regression model with one explanatory variable --- often a given role
model's interest in a specific topic --- is followed by multiple
regression models with control variables for three blocs of variables:
(1) personality traits, (2) role models' gender, and (3) socio-economic
status variables. Personality traits include the agency and communality
scales developed in Chapter~\ref{sec-chap2}, while socio-economic status
variables include confounding variables which have been linked with
political interest and could therefore mediate any given relationship
found between two persons' political interest. These include gender,
age, language, ethnicity, and immigrant status.

\hypertarget{parentchild-political-discussions-by-gender}{%
\subsection{Parent--Child Political Discussions by
Gender}\label{parentchild-political-discussions-by-gender}}

Figure~\ref{fig-parents} shows, for each topic, which parent students
report discussing the most often with. Out of 698 students, after
removing non-answers and missing data, 82\% of students report
discussing health care more often with their mother than father, and
74\% say the same for education. To the contrary, 64\% of students say
they discuss law and crime more often with their father, as well as 68\%
for partisan politics and 71\% for international affairs. There are more
non-answers and missing data for partisan politics, which presumably
means no parent discusses the topic at home with their children. When
these results are broken down by students' gender, very similar results
are found for boys and girls, with one exception: in general, for all
types of discussions --- regardless of their political nature --- 62\%
of boys say they have more discussions with their mother, compared with
82\% of girls who report the same.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{_graphs/ParentTopicsGrey.pdf}

}

\caption{\label{fig-parents}Topic most often discussed with parents by
child gender, 2023 CCPIS data}

\end{figure}

These results match with what previous literature has found about women
reporting more interest in education and health care, and men reporting
more interest in partisan politics, law and crime, and international
affairs. Hypotheses 1b and 1c are therefore corroborated, as opposed to
Hypothesis 1a. Also in line with the literature, parents seem to talk
about various political topics just as much with their sons as with
their daughters. Hypothesis 1d is therefore corroborated, as opposed to
Hypotheses 1e and 1f, which hypothesized agency-related topics would be
more prevalent in discussions with sons while communality-related topics
would be more prevalent in discussions with daughters.

Figure~\ref{fig-parentsmomdad} shows the extent to which mothers discuss
each of the five topics, and the same for fathers. Mothers
overwhelmingly discuss education and health care according to their
children, while fathers discuss international affairs more than other
topics but seem like a more heterogeneous group. Despite partisan
politics being the least discussed topic by both parents, fathers are
much more likely to discuss it than mothers according to this metric.
For law and crime too, fathers are more likely to discuss it. Again,
when these results are broken down by students' gender, very similar
results are found for boys and girls.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{_graphs/ParentTopicsMomDadGrey.pdf}

}

\caption{\label{fig-parentsmomdad}Topic most often discussed by mothers
and fathers, 2023 CCPIS data}

\end{figure}

The gender gap in political topics discussed is pretty stark between
mothers and fathers, according to their children's assessments. It is
important to specify that given the question's phrasing, it is not clear
if these interactions are initiated by parents or by their children, and
if it is reflective of top-down or trickle-up political socialization
(McDevitt and Chaffee 2002). Moreover, the question does not ask
children to specify a percentage of interactions about each topic
started by the mother or father; it simply asks them to pick the parent
most likely to have these discussions with them. There is no assumption
that mothers are the only ones talking about health care and fathers the
only ones to talk about international affairs, but on average, they are
more likely to raise this topic than the other-gender parent --- with
the caveat that children may have been thinking about health care and
education in a broader sense than simply their political aspects,
despite prior prompting that should encourage them to think about
political aspects.

Regardless, the fact that results among boys and girls both strongly
point in the same direction is revealing. It makes little doubt that
mothers and fathers speak differently about politics when they raise the
topic with their children. Both questions were formulated in concrete
ways, asking children the extent to which they discuss these topics with
their parents. There is no Hawthorne effect among kids; they would not
have an expected answer. Parents speak in starkly different ways about
politics to their children, and this confirms that political
socialization is a deeply gendered process.

\hypertarget{topics-parents-discuss-the-most}{%
\subsection{Topics Parents Discuss the
Most}\label{topics-parents-discuss-the-most}}

When it comes to parents' role in political interest transmission, Table
\ref{tab:lmeParentCtrl} shows the relationship between students'
interest in each of the five topics and the gender of the parent who
discusses the topic with them the most. Children's interest in either of
the five topics does not seem to be related to the gender of the parent
who discusses the topic the most; the topic-by-topic analysis shows all
relationships are statistically insignificant. However, when aggregated,
the fact that their father discusses a topic more than their mother
increases sons' interest in that topic by an average of 0.5 point on an
11-point scale (\emph{p}\textless0.001). The gender of the parent who
discusses more a topic does not have a significant effect on daughters'
interest in that topic.\footnote{Appendix~\ref{sec-appendix5} shows very
  similar findings when control variables are removed.}

\subsection{Topics Most Often Discussed with
Mothers}\label{topics-most-often-discussed-with-mothers}}

Table \ref{tab:lmeAgentsCtrl} shows students' interest in each of the
five topics depending on whether this topic is the one they most often
discuss with various role models, starting with mothers. For boys,
interest in either of the five topics or their aggregate is unrelated to
their discussion of these topics with their mothers. For girls, interest
in law and crime is related to their mothers discussing law and crime
(\emph{p}\textless0.01), and the same is true for education
(\emph{p}\textless0.01), partisan politics (\emph{p}\textless0.05) and
health care (\emph{p}\textless0.1) are all positively predicted by their
mothers discussing these topics with them. Only when it comes to
international affairs is there no statistically significant effect ---
but the effect size is still largely positive. In the aggregate, if a
girl's mother discusses mostly one of the five topics, her interest in
that topic is expected to increase by 0.9 points on the 11-point scale
(\emph{p}\textless0.001).

\subsection{Topics Most Often Discussed with
Fathers}\label{topics-most-often-discussed-with-fathers}}

Table \ref{tab:lmeAgentsCtrl} then shows students' interest in a
specific topic depending on it being the topic they most often discuss
with their father(s). For boys, interest in partisan politics is related
to their fathers discussing partisan politics (\emph{p}\textless0.01),
and the same is true for health care (\emph{p}\textless0.1). At the
aggregate level, if a boy's father discusses mostly one of the five
topics, their interest in that topic is expected to increase by 0.9
point on an 11-point interest scale (\emph{p}\textless0.001). For girls,
interest in law and crime is related to their fathers discussing law and
crime (\emph{p}\textless0.01). At the aggregate level, if a girl's
father discusses mostly one of the five topics, their interest in that
topic is expected to increase by 0.5 point on an 11-point interest scale
(\emph{p}\textless0.1). None of the other topic-specific father--son and
father--daughter relationships are statistically significant at the 90\%
confidence level.

Overall, results from Table \ref{tab:lmeAgentsCtrl} lend support to
Hypothesis 1g, which suggests that children's interest in a given
political topic should be more related to their same-gender parent
discussing that topic with them than their other-gender parent
discussing it with them. Fathers' influence on sons seems to be similar
to mothers' influence on daughters, contrary to some past research in
which the influence of mothers on political interest development was
deemed to be generally stronger than fathers. Table
\ref{tab:lmeParentCtrl} also shows that when a topic is discussed by
their father rather than their mother, their interest in that topic is
more likely to increase. For girls, whichever parent discusses a topic
more does not significantly predict their interest in that topic when
the question is asked this way. Overall, none of the relationships
tested lend support to Hypothesis 1j, that mothers' influence in the
transmission of interest in political topics would be greater than
fathers.

The topic-by-topic analysis does not show a consistent pattern, and it
does not appear that interest in cooperation-oriented topics such as
health care and education is more likely to be transmitted by mothers
while interest in assertion-oriented topics is more likely to be
transmitted by fathers. Consequently, Hypotheses 1h and 1i are not
corroborated.\footnote{Appendix~\ref{sec-appendix5} reproduces Tables
  \ref{tab:lmeParentCtrl} and \ref{tab:lmeAgentsCtrl} without controls.
  Generally, the same relationships are found. Father--daughter interest
  transmission at the aggregate level increases to \emph{p}\textless0.01
  but remains substantively smaller than both father--son and
  mother--daughter transmission. Mother--daughter interest transmission
  for certain topics seems to decline, while it increases for other
  topics. Mother--son and father--son law and crime interest
  transmission also both become marginally significant at the
  \emph{p}\textless0.05 level.}

\hypertarget{age-trends}{%
\subsection{Age Trends}\label{age-trends}}

Figure~\ref{fig-discussyoctrl} shows relationships between parents'
discussion of certain topics and children's interest in those topics
broken down by age group. For the sake of simplicity and to avoid small
sample sizes, topic-by-topic analyses are excluded, with all analyses
aggregating each parent discussion--child interest pair. Results are
mixed, but seem to show that in some respects, older teenagers (ages
16--18) are more influenced by their parents' discussion of certain
topics than 10--15-year-olds. Notably, for girls, the influence of both
their father and mother is only statistically significant among 16--18
year-olds, and it grows in size compared with girls aged 10--15. No such
difference between age groups is found among boys. However, for boys
aged 16--18, when their parent most interested in a specific topic is
their father, they become more interested in that topic, while this
relationship is weaker and non-significant for boys aged 10--15. These
results provide mixed evidence for Hypothesis 1k: aging makes more
statistically significant relationships emerge, but the effect sizes
only become somewhat wider between age groups. Yet, among
10--15-year-olds, only father--son political interest transmission is
statistically significant, which could indicate that early parental
socialization is more limited than what was previously thought. It could
be the case that due to a more limited sample size, smaller effect sizes
are present but do not reach statistical significance. This would be
consistent with the finding that, for all significant parent--child
interest relationships found among 16--18-year-olds, the direction of
the relationship among 10--15-year-olds is the same --- but the
coefficient is larger. Moreover, again confirming Hypothesis 1g, the
largest effect sizes among 16--18-year-olds are for mother--daughter and
father--son transmission. Substantively, when a topic is the one their
mother discusses the most, 16--18-year-old daughters' interest in that
topic increases on average by 1.2 points. Similarly, when a topic is the
one their father discusses the most, 16--18-year-old sons' interest in
that topic increases on average by 1 point.

\hypertarget{discussion-1}{%
\section{Discussion}\label{discussion-1}}

Overall, the analysis generally confirms the main hypotheses put
forward, with a few minor caveats. Broadly, it seems that social
learning theory applies just as well when political interest
transmission is evaluated across a range of political topics --- but not
necessarily for each topic measured individually.

Descriptive results show a clear trend: mothers are much more likely to
speak about education and health care, while fathers are more likely to
speak about the other three topics. These trends mirror previous
literature on interest in these topics.

Moreover, fathers' discussion of various political topics is related to
their sons' interest in these topics, while mothers' discussion of
various political topics is related to their daughters' interest in
these topics. Mothers also seem to have a weaker impact on sons'
political interest, while fathers seem to lack influence over their
daughters' political interest. Political interest seems to trickle down
from parents to children in gendered ways.

Results by age groups seem to indicate political interest grows with
time, but these results also seem to apply to girls more than to boys
--- and the increase seem rather limited. Future studies conducted among
a larger number of children may be able to see more clearly time trends
for the growth of parent--child political interest transmission
potential.

Results highlight the transmission potential of parents for interest in
various political topics to their children and they reinforce the idea
that, in some respects, there are different socialization routes for
girls and boys.

\chapter{Homophily and Political Interest: How Do Peer Groups Create
Gendered Political Interests?}\label{sec-chap5}}

Gender homophily and social learning both suggest that children are
influenced by same-gender models. These models include parents, as
social learning theory finds it, and peers, as gender homophily theory
finds it. However, it might be the case that other role models,
including teachers and social media influencers, also have a broader
influence on children of their gender. This would be coherent with the
idea that observer-model similarity encourages children to model their
behaviour on people who resemble them. Is gender homophily just one
example among many of social learning through observer-model similarity?

Friends and acquaintances can contribute to the development of political
interest, mainly through political discussions. Political discussions
with friends and acquaintances increase political interest among child
and adult respondents (Klofstad 2007; Shehata and Amnå 2019). Peer-group
diversity can also contribute to the development of political interest.
The size of one's social network has been found to have a positive
relationship with political interest, while political disagreement is
not related to it (Pattie and Johnston 2009).

Political discussions among peers typically exhibit gender effects.
Among adults, leaving aside relatives, 84\% of men report discussing
politics only with men, while 64\% of women report discussing politics
only with women (Huckfeldt and Sprague 1995). This could be a by-product
of gender homophily since people generally spend more time with other
people of the same gender.

\hypertarget{data-analysis-2}{%
\section{Data Analysis}\label{data-analysis-2}}

Questions are also asked about students' peers and interests. First,
students are asked ``What is the gender of most of your friends?'' They
can choose either girls, boys, or ``About the same for both genders''.
Second, the following question is asked: ``Among these five topics,
which one do you discuss most often with your male friends?'' Each of
the five topics is listed, and the same question is then asked for
female friends.

Gender homophily holds among the sample of students: when excluding
students who say they have as many friends of both genders, no less than
95\% of boys and 91\% of girls report that most of their friends are of
the same genders as theirs.

Figure~\ref{fig-peers-genderage} shows that

\subsection{Topics Most Often Discussed with Female
Friends}\label{topics-most-often-discussed-with-female-friends}}

Figure~\ref{fig-femalefriends} shows students' interest in a specific
topic depending on it being the topic they most often discuss with their
female friends. For both boys and girls, interest in law and crime is
related to their female friends discussing law and crime
(\emph{p}\textless0.05). If a girl's female friends discuss mostly law
and crime among the five topics, her interest in law and crime is
expected to increase by 1.6 points on the 11-point scale. For boys, the
expected increase is 1.1 points. For girls, interest in international
affairs and partisan politics is also related to their female friends
discussing the topic with them (\emph{p}\textless0.05 and
\emph{p}\textless0.01 respectively), but not for boys. If a girl's
female friends discuss mostly international affairs among the five
topics, her interest in this topic is expected to increase by 1.2
points. If her female friends discuss mostly partisan politics, her
interest in that topic is expected to increase by a large 6.4 points.
All other relationships are non-significant at the \emph{p}\textless0.05
level.

Friends}\label{topics-most-often-discussed-with-male-friends}}

Figure~\ref{fig-malefriends} shows students' interest in a specific
topic depending on it being the topic they most often discuss with their
male friends. For boys, interest in law and crime is related to their
male friends discussing law and crime (\emph{p}\textless0.001), but not
for girls. If a boy's male friends discuss mostly law and crime among
the five topics, his interest in law and crime is expected to increase
by 1.5 points on the 11-point scale. Interest in international relations
among boys is also related to their male friends discussing the topic
with them (\emph{p}\textless0.001), but not among girls. If a boy's male
friends discuss mostly international relations, his interest in that
topic is expected to increase by 1.6 points. For girls, interest in
partisan politics is predicted by their male friends discussing the
topic (2-point gain, \emph{p}\textless0.05), but not for boys. All other
relationships are non-significant at the \emph{p}\textless0.05 level.

\end{figure}

Patterns from Figure~\ref{fig-femalefriends} and
Figure~\ref{fig-malefriends} are somewhat complex to understand and do
not seem consistent with gender homophily theory. While having male
friends who discuss international politics strongly increases boys'
interest in that topic, for girls, having female friends who discuss the
topic also increases their interest. For boys, having friends who
discuss law and crime strongly increases their interest, while for
girls, the same can be said about partisan politics. Therefore, gendered
factors seem to be at play, but hypothesis 2 cannot be confirmed on the
basis of these results.\footnote{Appendix~\ref{sec-appendix6} reproduces
  Figure~\ref{fig-femalefriends} and Figure~\ref{fig-malefriends} while
  adding controls for age, age squared, language, immigrant status and
  race. The same relationships are found. Female friends--girl law and
  crime interest transmission loses statistical significance, while male
  friends--boy partisan politics transmission becomes statistically
  significant (\emph{p}\textless0.05).}

For the two topics for which adult women report more interest than adult
men --- health care and education --- peers seem to have no effect on
the development of interest in these topics. It could be the case that
health care and education become relevant to women as they grow older
and start caring for children and elderly people --- something quite
different in nature than the kinds of conversations teenagers presumably
have about education and health care.

\hypertarget{discussion-2}{%
\section{Discussion}\label{discussion-2}}

For gender homophily theory, again, the main descriptive results
highlight the importance of this phenomenon: among those who say their
friends are mostly of one gender, more than 90\% of students, both girls
and boys, report they have more friends of their own gender. Yet,
multilevel regression results are not straightforward to analyze. Girls
and boys seem to be interested in some topics their peers discuss but
not others, and these topics tend to be different for children of both
genders.

manipulation?

``students who actively use social media have an increased level of
support for conventional citizenship values and demonstrate more
interest in active political participation in the future.'' (Blaskó,
Costa, and Vera-Toscano 2019)

storytelling can be effective in increasing political engagement online
(Vromen, Halpin, and Vaughan 2022) (not sure for interest)

\hypertarget{media}{%
\subsection{Media}\label{media}}

Research has been done on the influence of political news on the
development of political interest among adolescents. Although political
interest can influence news media consumption, studies have shown the
relationship also works in the other direction: watching more political
news on traditional media and on social media has a positive effect on
political interest (Holt et al. 2013; Shehata and Amnå 2019).

Websites can also have a positive influence on people's political
interest, although this literature might be somewhat old. Lupia and
Philpot (2005) find young adults can gain political interest by visiting
informative websites under certain conditions.

Studies mostly find boys use the Internet more frequently than girls.
Willoughby (2008) finds that boys use the Internet just as frequently as
girls in early high school, but girls' Internet use decreases in late
high school, notably due to a decline in gaming, making older teenage
boys more active on the Internet than girls. Tsai and Tsai (2010) also
find boys use the Internet more than girls in junior high school, but
purpose-wise, girls use the Internet for communication while boys use it
more for Web exploration.

Online political engagement is more prevalent among boys than girls
according to Cicognani et al. (2012), but Livingstone, Bober, and
Helsper (2005) find that girls visit more political and civic websites.

\hypertarget{schools}{%
\subsection{Schools}\label{schools}}

Schools can influence childhood socialization in many ways, including
citizenship education classes, classroom political discussions,
extracurricular activities, and active learning strategies.

While earlier studies found only weak links between citizenship
education classes and political interest (Langton and Jennings 1968),
more recent studies find a positive link (Dassonneville et al. 2012;
Mahéo 2019; Neundorf, Niemi, and Smets 2016). \emph{Citizenship
education} and \emph{civic education} classes include classes teaching
facts about government and politics but also promoting political
engagement (Althof and Berkowitz 2006; Themistokleous and Avraamidou
2016).

Extracurricular and active learning activities can affect youth
political interest. The number of class group projects and membership in
the school council are positively related to political interest, but not
participation in voluntary associations nor parliamentary visits
(Dassonneville et al. 2012).

Classroom political discussions in general can also increase students'
political interest. For instance, students' perceptions of an \emph{open
classroom climate} marginally increase their political interest
(Dassonneville et al. 2012). An \emph{open classroom climate} is one in
which ``students experience the discussion of social and political
issues while in class and {[}in which{]} they feel comfortable
contributing their own opinions during such discussions'' (D. E.
Campbell 2007, 62).

The role of classroom political discussions in political socialization
might be gendered. For instance, Mahony (1985) finds that girls are less
likely to participate in classroom discussions of politics because boys
make the classroom climate aggressive. However, Rosenthal, Jones, and
Rosenthal (2003) show that, while girls' presence has a slightly
positive impact on girls' speaking time, interruptions occur as
frequently between adolescents whatever their gender, and studies find
that 8th- to 12th-grade girls are \emph{more} likely than boys to report
an open classroom climate (Blankenship 1990; D. E. Campbell 2007;
Maurissen, Claes, and Barber 2018).\footnote{Among adults, Karpowitz and
  Mendelberg (2014) and Beauvais (2020) also show that women's and men's
  relative speaking time in a deliberative and decision-making setting
  depends on the number of women. When decisions are made by a majority,
  the presence of more women leads to more speaking time for each woman.}

TITRE DE LA RECHERCHE : Socialisation politique genrée : Pourquoi les
femmes et les hommes diffèrent encore en matière d'intérêt politique

CHERCHEUR PRINCIPAL : Alexandre Fortier-Chouinard, étudiant au doctorat
en science politique à l'University of Toronto

CONTEXTE DU PROJET : Thèse de doctorat dirigée le professeur Christopher
Brian Cochrane

RENSEIGNEMENTS SUR LE PROJET : Ma thèse vise à répondre à la question
suivante : Comment émergent les différences de genre dans l'intérêt pour
différents sujets politiques?

VOTRE PARTICIPATION : Votre participation à cette recherche consistera à
remplir le présent questionnaire comprenant 22 questions portant sur
l'intérêt politique, sur vous-mêmes et sur votre entourage. Bien que les
réponses à chacune des questions soient importantes pour la recherche,
vous demeurez libre de choisir de ne pas répondre à l'une ou l'autre
d'entre elles ou encore de mettre fin à votre participation à tout
moment. La participation à cette étude ne sera pas évaluée par votre
enseignant. Toutefois, les données obtenues d'un(e) participant(e) qui
choisirait de se retirer du projet après avoir soumis son questionnaire
ne pourront être détruites. Une question facultative vous demandera
votre adresse courriel. Si vous décidez de répondre à cette question,
qui sera seulement utilisée pour vous contacter pour des sondages de
suivi facultatifs dans 5 et 10 ans, vous pouvez m'envoyer un courriel à
\texttt{alexandre.fortier.chouinard@mail.utoronto.ca} pour retirer votre
adresse courriel de la liste à n'importe quel moment. Une question vous
demandera votre numéro d'élève. Nous ne pouvons pas lier cette
information avec aucune information personnelle au sujet de l'élève,
incluant son nom, et cette information peut seulement être utilisée pour
lier des questionnaires soumis à différents moments dans le temps par le
même élève.

CONSERVATION DES DONNÉES : Le programme d'éthique de la recherche peut
avoir un accès confidentiel aux données pour aider à garantir le respect
des procédures de protection des participants. Les données issues de vos
réponses seront détruites en août 2037.

REMERCIEMENTS : Votre collaboration est précieuse pour nous permettre de
réaliser cette étude. C'est pourquoi nous tenons à vous remercier pour
le temps et l'attention que vous acceptez de consacrer à votre
participation.

ATTESTATION DU CONSENTEMENT : Le simple retour du sondage en ligne
rempli sera considéré comme l'expression implicite de votre consentement
à participer au projet.

RENSEIGNEMENTS SUPPLÉMENTAIRES: Si vous avez des questions sur la
recherche ou sur les implications de votre participation, veuillez
communiquer avec Alexandre Fortier-Chouinard (courriel :
\texttt{alexandre.fortier.chouinard@mail.utoronto.ca}) ou le superviseur
du projet, le professeur Christopher Brian Cochrane (courriel :
\texttt{christopher.cochrane@utoronto.ca}). Si vous avez des questions
sur vos droits en tant que participant(e) à la recherche, vous pouvez
également contacter le bureau d'éthique de la recherche de l'University
of Toronto (\texttt{ethics.review@utoronto.ca}, 416-946-3273). Nous
prenons toutes les précautions de sécurité pour réduire le risque de
propagation de la COVID-19.
