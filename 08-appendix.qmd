Title: "Participation of your schools to an academic project"

Hello,

I am contacting your school board as part of my doctoral dissertation project in political science, which focuses on the role of gender and social networks in the development of political interest. As part of my research, I will be administering a short online survey to elementary and high school students from various schools. If possible, I would love to do some of my data collection in schools from \[name of school board or school service centre\]. Should you agree, I would then contact each selected school individually in order to get approvals of the school's governing board, teachers, and students.

I am taking all safety precautions to reduce the risk of spread of COVID-19. If you would like more information about my project, you can email me at alexandre.fortier.chouinard@mail.utoronto.ca or contact me at \[phone number of the researcher\]. I will be happy to answer any questions you may have!

Thank you for giving me a positive or negative answer as soon as possible.

Title: "Participation to an academic project"

Hello,

I am contacting you as part of my doctoral dissertation project in political science, which focuses on the role of gender and social networks in the development of political interest. As part of my research, I will be administering a short online survey to elementary and high school students from various schools. Your school has agreed to allow me to conduct part of my data collection with teachers of \[name of required social studies course in the province\]. The principal has provided me with your contact information. Would it be possible for me to take about 15 minutes in \[your classrooms/classroom\] in \[grade\] in the next few weeks to have students complete a questionnaire? Other than the 15 minutes in your classrooms \[and a potential follow-up 15-minute questionnaire (Quebec only)\], this requires nothing more from you.

I am taking all safety precautions to reduce the risk of spread of COVID-19. You can email me back at alexandre.fortier.chouinard@mail.utoronto.ca or contact me at \[phone number of the researcher\]. Please feel free to ask me questions about my project if you have any, it will be my pleasure to answer them.

Hoping for a positive response from you, I look forward to hearing from you!
