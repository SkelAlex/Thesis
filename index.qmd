# Theories and Explanations for the Gender Gap in Political Interest {#sec-chap1}

Traditional political science studies have long shown that men are generally more interested in politics than women [@burns2001; @inglehart1981; @inglehart2003; @verba1997], a finding that is consistent across countries. However, this difference might be more apparent than real, driven by how people interpret survey questions asking them to indicate how interested they are in politics. Several recent studies [@campbellrosie2008; @ferrin2020; @ferrin2023; @keeling2023; @kuhn2004; @sabella2004; @tormos2022] show that people do not think about the full range of political actions when they are asked questions about their political interest; they mostly think about partisan politics and, to a lesser extent, international affairs. Moreover, men report being more interested than women in certain political topics --- notably partisan politics --- while women report being more interested in other aspects --- like health care and education politics. This suggests that asking people about their general political interest induces a gender bias in the measure of political interest, which stems from the fact that partisan politics is top of mind for people when they are asked about politics.

Gender differences in political interest have been found to be rooted in childhood socialization. Studies have found parents and peers play an important role in children's political socialization [@dostiegoulet2009en; @huckfeldt1995; @mayer2004; @neundorf2013], especially when they share the children's gender [@beauregard2008; @owen1988]. Already at age 6, boys and girls are more likely to draw male than female politicians when asked to draw a politician [@bos2022], suggesting aspects of gendered political socialization happen at a young age. While structural, institutional, biological, and life-cycle factors have also been linked to the development of political interest, childhood socialization is one of its most important determinants [@jennings1981] --- and political interest remains stable from an early age [@prior2010; @prior2019]. However, parental transmission of political interest has only been studied using the traditional one-item measure of political interest, while the gendered aspects of peer transmission of political interest have not been formalized. This dissertation answers the following questions: *"How do men and women differ with regard to political interest, and why?"* In response to these questions, I contend that, as they grow up, most boys develop more interest in competitive aspects of politics while most girls develop more interest in cooperative aspects of politics. I further suggest that these segregated interests mainly emerge as a result of gendered socialization by their same-gender parent(s) and peers. Notably, interest in *partisan* politics is distinctly transmitted from men to boys. Therefore, I argue that gender differences are more about the type of political interest rather than the level of political interest. These differences explain the well-documented gap in political interest in general, but also question how *general* political interest can effectively be measured by a single-item survey measure, especially when this measure is meant to uncover gender differences.

One may wonder how relevant it is to make an extensive study about gender differences in political interests. First, political interests are relevant to study since they influence the political representation of women and men. Interest in politics --- in particular partisan politics --- is linked to greater political ambition, and men's greater interest in partisan politics may lead them to be over-represented in political institutions [@fox2005]. Since policies often have different effects on men and women, which can be influenced by policymakers' gender [@chattopadhyay2004; @donato2008; @rayment2020], the fact that women are under-represented in the legislative and executive spheres has practical consequences for the kinds of legislation adopted. Second, political interest has also been linked with other forms of political participation [@cicognani2012]. It is therefore possible that interest in various political topics increases the range of political actions in which men and women take part.

## Conceptual Definitions

Before defining relevant concepts such as political engagement, political participation and political interest, it is important to first define what *politics* is. Politics is a contested concept and has been for a long time [@gallie1956]. For @weber1919, "[t]he concept is extremely broad and comprises any kind of leadership in action" (1). More recent sources have variously described politics as the art of government, as public affairs in general, as the non-violent resolution of disputes, as power and the distribution of resources, or as the conflictual discussion of controversial topics [@conover2002; @fitzgerald2013; @heywood2019; @lane1962; @sapiro2013; @walsh2004]. Among these, @heywood2019 offers one of the most comprehensive definitions:

```{=latex}
\begingroup
\setstretch{1}
\begin{quote}
Politics, in its broadest sense, is the activity through which people make, preserve and amend the general rules under which they live. Politics is inextricably linked to the phenomena of conflict and cooperation. On the one hand, the existence of rival opinions, different wants, competing needs, and opposing interests guarantees disagreement about the rules under which people live. On the other hand, people recognize that, in order to influence these rules or ensure their enforcement, they must work with others (34).
\end{quote}
\endgroup
```

In this dissertation, for the sake of clarity, *politics* is defined using Heywood's [-@heywood2019] definition. Importantly, this definition emphasizes the notions of cooperation and competition, thus going beyond Weber's [-@weber1919] notion of leadership. More than a partisan game, politics includes actions that preserve the policy status quo as well as actions that aim at disrupting it, including contentious politics [@tilly2015] and interest groups that seek to influence the rules --- from the international level to the local level.

The umbrella term *political engagement* is used throughout this dissertation to describe forms of commitment to politics through either *attitudes*, *actions*, or both --- leaving aside the ideological content of these attitudes and actions. The word *commitment* is important here, as any action may be viewed as political but only some are intended to be political. Choosing a shirt may be a political act, but is not defined as political *engagement* unless it is intended to be --- e.g., buying a brand because of its governance model or moral positioning on an issue. Political engagement has been used to refer to political interest, political discussion, political knowledge, voter turnout, political efficacy, and/or party membership [@coffe2010; @gidengil2010; @verba1997]. More narrowly, *political participation* is used to refer to political actions, such as boycotting, participating in protests, donating money to candidates, voting, or working with interest groups or voluntary associations that seek to influence policy at any level --- international, national, provincial, local, school board, and so on. *Political ambition* refers to the *desire* to run for political office at any level [@fox2005]. This desire can be short-term or long-term. Political ambition is a form of political engagement through attitudes rather than actions.

*Political interest*, this study's main variable of interest, is defined as "the degree to which politics arouses a citizen's curiosity" [@vandeth1990, 278]. It therefore involves both being aware of politics and caring about it. Like political ambition, it is an attitudinal component of political engagement. When used in this dissertation, the concept is meant to refer to people's self-reported interest in politics in general. However, studies show that typical survey respondents, including both women and men, do not think of politics the same way scholars do, and instead emphasize partisan politics more specifically when answering survey questions on political interest [@campbellrosie2008; @ferrin2020; @ferrin2023].^[Women are more likely to view gender issues as political than men, but otherwise men and women seem to define what counts as political in similar ways [@ferrin2020; @fitzgerald2013].] Measures of political interest therefore tap into something different from the theoretical definition of politics used for this dissertation, as it is biased towards partisan politics. For similar reasons, when *political discussion* and *political efficacy* are mentioned in this dissertation, they also refer to concepts that are likely tilted toward partisan politics.

*Interest in partisan politics* is defined as an interest in the competition between political parties that is visible in political institutions and election campaigns --- as opposed to interest in policies, society issues or contentious politics, e.g. a non-party-sponsored protest or a discussion about the future of the health care system. When studies explicitly measure interest in partisan politics, this dissertation uses the expression *interest in partisan politics* rather than *political interest*.

Finally, the concept of *gender* is defined here as "sets of socially constructed meanings of masculinities and femininities, derived from context-specific identifications of sex, that is, male and female, men and women" [@beckwith2010, 160]. While gender is a social construct, it is already observable at a young age and further develops through time due to biological factors --- not environmental ones [@hatemi2012]. Other than men and women, various other gender identities have been identified, including transgender, non-binary, gender-queer, and gender-ambiguous people [@matsuno2017]. According to the 2021 Canadian Census, people who identify as transgender or non-binary made up 0.33% of all Canadians [@cbc2022]. Due to concerns with sample size, in this dissertation, only people who identify as men, women, boys, and girls are studied, as in most studies of gender differences in political engagement. Further research using purposely selected samples of people who do not identify as men or women will be needed to get a better understanding of the determinants of their political interest.

## Gender Differences in Political Interest and Engagement: An Overview

In Canada and other Western countries, differences in political engagement are complex and often subject to disagreement between studies. On some aspects of political engagement, it is hard to tell whether men or women are more engaged. Women seem to be about as likely as men to vote in national elections [@kostelka2019], to win elections when they run for office [@golder2017; @sevi2019], to participate in demonstrations and political rallies [@coffe2010], and to donate money to political candidates (@coffe2010; @tolley2022).^[For donations, there is conflicting evidence. @coffe2010 find women are more likely than men to donate money to political groups in the United States, while @tolley2022 find they donate less often and lower amounts of money than men in Canada.] Furthermore, compared to men, women express equally high levels of political trust (@dassonneville2012; @schoon2011),^[@schoon2011 find women have higher levels of political trust than men in the United Kingdom, but @dassonneville2012 find null results in the Belgian context.] and express similar levels of interest in local politics [@coffe2013; @hayes1993].^[Controlling for some of the other political attitudes mentioned here, women become *more* interested in local politics [@coffe2013] and *more* likely to vote in national elections [@coffe2010] than men, but the current focus is on raw gender differences.]

However, for other aspects of political engagement, there are indications of men being more politically engaged than women. Studies have found that compared to women, men are more likely to be interested in politics in general, including national and international politics [@verba1997]; to discuss politics [@beauvais2020; @rosenthal2003]; to have an opinion on political issues [@atkesonrapoport2003]; to try to convince other people to vote for a candidate [@beauregard2014]; to feel a sense of political efficacy, both internal and external^[*Internal efficacy*: an individual's "self-perception that they are capable of understanding politics and competent enough to participate in political acts such as voting." *External efficacy*: an individual's "perception of being able to have an impact on politics" [@gidengil2008, 538].] [@gidengil2008; @verba1997]; to give correct answers to knowledge questions on political institutions [@dolan2011; @ferrin2018; @fraile2014; @norris2004; @stolle2010; @verba1997]; to vote in second-order elections^[Second-order elections include European elections, municipal elections, and most types of other sub-regional elections.] [@dassonneville2021; @kostelka2019]; to be active political party members [@coffe2010; @stolle2011]; to be politically ambitious; and to run for political office [@devroe2023; @fox2004; @fox2005; @lawless2010; @fox2023; @tolley2023].

Finally, there is also research that suggests women are more politically engaged in some aspects. For instance, women are more likely than men to be interested in health care, education and gender issues [@campbellrosie2008; @ferrin2020; @kuhn2004; @sabella2004; @tormos2022], give correct answers to knowledge questions on government services and social issues [@ferrin2018; @keeling2023; @norris2004; @stolle2010], and engage in private activism such as boycotting and signing petitions [@coffe2010].

Overall, the types of political engagement in which men appear to be more involved are more related to political institutions, while those in which women are more involved are more informal and --- in the case of boycotts and petitions --- anti-system. Since more power is typically concentrated in political institutions than in private activism in Canada, the influence of women in Canadian politics is limited.

## Consequences from the Point of View of Democratic Theory

Different aspects of political engagement are correlated and influence each other [@bennett1989; @coffe2010; @coffe2013; @ondercin2011]. This means that a gender gap in one aspect of political engagement can contribute to a gap in another aspect. Importantly, when gender differences in *partisan political interest* emerge at a young age, they can have consequences for at least two types of substantive citizen participation when children become adults: discussing partisan politics with other people and running for elected political office.

### Political Discussion

Studies report men are more likely than women to report discussing politics frequently [@kittilson2012], but men and women tend to think about *partisan politics* more specifically when they think about the concept of politics [@campbellrosie2008; @ferrin2020]. Still, Heywood's [-@heywood2019] definition of politics goes beyond partisan competition and elections, including all the ways in which people make and change the rules that govern them. Traditional survey questions asking respondents to report how often they discuss politics therefore mostly tap into the extent to which individuals discuss partisan politics, which is one aspect of politics on which men typically report more interest. As people usually discuss the topics they are most interested in, it seems likely that women discuss more often political topics for which they report more interest, such as health care or gender issues, although survey questions typically do not ask what kinds of political topics people discuss the most. Political discussion of various topics is seen as something desirable in participatory democracy,^[The long-standing concept of participatory democracy is also well accepted among feminist and intersectional theorists [@collins2017; @phillips1992].] while partisan politics is only one means through which relevant issues are often addressed.

Discussing with people who have different ideas and views also creates a phenomenon of collective intelligence [@landemore2013], which is seen as a desirable outcome from a democratic point of view, since it has been found both to reduce political polarization and to produce better reasoning, i.e., a better capacity at finding and evaluating arguments in deliberative context [@mercier2012]. Therefore, there are important democratic reasons to seek to identify the socialization elements that lead to more diversity in political discussions --- men and women have different life experiences but also, often, different ideological viewpoints [@gidengil2005].

### Running for Elected Political Office

Gender differences in interest in partisan politics may also contribute to the gender gap in institutional political representation by fostering different levels of political ambition between genders. Studies have repeatedly found that men have more political ambition than women. For instance, there are twice as many men as women who seek to be nominated as candidates in Canadian elections [@tolley2023]. This might be related to parental socialization. In the United States, @fox2005 have found that women "are more than twice as likely as men to consider themselves 'not at all qualified' to run for office (29% of women, compared to 14% of men) \[and\] are roughly 22% less likely than men to report parental encouragement" (654). These two findings still stand in their 2021 follow-up study [@fox2023]. Moreover, when primed about the competitive aspects of politics, women's political ambition declines while men's remains stable [@preece2015]. Political interest, self-perceived qualifications, and family socialization, while not the only factors,^[Compared to men, highly visible female politicians are more often the subject of negative media coverage [@fernandezgarcia2016; @goodyeargrant2013], uncivil tweets [@rheault2019], and financial barriers [@thomas2013]. These factors could also help to explain women's lower political ambition, which could explain their lower levels of representation in institutional politics. Several of these studies are conducted in Canada.] all predict political ambition --- i.e., having previously considered the possibility of running for office.

Gender differences in partisan political interest and political efficacy might therefore indirectly help to explain why women are under-represented in legislative assemblies in the vast majority of countries [@ipu2024].^[When it comes to direct discrimination against women by voters and parties, the evidence is more mixed, with some studies pointing in the direction of women being discriminated against while others point in the direction of men being discriminated against. Discrimination against women by gatekeepers [@ashe2012] and by parties who make them candidates in hopeless ridings [@thomasbodet2013] might explain part of the gender gap in legislative representation in the country. Moreover, female candidates tend to be more qualified than male candidates, and voters hold them to more stringent qualification standards compared to male candidates [@bauer2020]. Still, in Canada, women receive as many votes as men on average [@sevi2019]. They are also *more* likely than men to win elections at the municipal level when they run [@lucas2021]. An international study also finds female candidates get on average 2 percentage points *more* of the popular vote than male candidates [@schwarz2022]. Finally, Canadian elites discriminate against *men* when it comes to providing advice to political aspirants [@dhima2022].] In Canada, too, political issues are most often settled by assemblies and executives where men are the majority. In 2009, women represented less than 25% of Canadian legislators at the federal, provincial, and municipal levels and only 15% of mayors [@tolley2011]. At the time of writing, while the Canadian federal cabinet is gender-balanced, nine out of ten provincial premiers and most of their ministers are men.^[As of April 27, 2024, Alberta was led by Danielle Smith, and British Columbia was the only province with a gender-balanced cabinet. The percentages of women ministers in each province's cabinets were 42% in Quebec, 40% in Manitoba, 39% in Nova Scotia, 35% in New Brunswick, 33% in Prince Edward Island, 29% in Newfoundland and Labrador, 28% in Saskatchewan, 27% in Ontario, and 20% in Alberta [@bc2024; @ab2024; @sk2024; @mb2024; @on2024; @qc2024; @nb2024; @pei2024; @ns2024; @nl2024].]

## Potential Explanations: The Emergence of Gender Differences

Several theories have been suggested to account for women's lower levels of self-reported political interest. This includes structural, institutional, and individual factors. Yet, no convincing unified theory has been proposed thus far to account for the emergence of this gender gap.

### Structural Factors

Studies have inquired into the role of two related types of structural factors that may explain gender differences in levels of political interest: society values and culture, and women's political under-representation.

First, broad cultural differences between countries and over time explain some of the aggregate variation in gender differences in political interest. @inglehart1981 shows that women are more interested in politics in traditionally Protestant countries than in traditionally Catholic countries. More recently, @inglehart2003 further suggest that modernization has a positive effect on cultural attitudes towards gender equality: as societies move from agrarian to industrial and then postindustrial, people become more open to gender equality. In particular, younger generations' attitudes become more supportive of norms of gender equality with this modernization process. Authors specify that history, religion, and institutions also play a role in shaping countries' trajectories towards such norms. @dassonneville2021 also demonstrate that cultural gender differences --- operationalized through differences in boys' and girls' math scores --- explain countries' gender gap in political interest. Still, these cross-country variations do not explain why significant gender gaps in political interest remain in countries where gender norms are more egalitarian or where women's rights are stronger.

Second, women politicians' relative absence in politics might also explain part of the gender gap in political interest. @wolbrecht2007 find that adolescent girls are more likely to discuss politics with friends in settings where there are more women legislators, while the increase for adolescent boys is non-significant, suggesting women politicians indeed can be role models who can increase girls' political interest. @mayer2004 and @bos2022 also find that adolescent boys and girls in the United States, Mexico, Japan, and China all think politics is a men's domain, and girls are more likely than boys to report so. Adolescent boys also report higher political interest. These two findings might be linked to the fact that citizens in these four countries, like almost all countries in the world, are represented by a majority of male legislators [@ipu2024]. Indeed, @buhlmann2012 find political interest is higher among men than women in 33 European countries, but this gap is smaller in countries with higher proportions of women in their countrywide legislative assembly. They suggest the relationship is not simply an artifact of reverse causality since it holds just as well in countries with gender quotas as those without gender quotas.^[There is thus a feedback loop: political interest leads to political ambition, which leads to political representation, which in turn leads to political interest for the group with a higher level of representation.] Still, predicted probabilities show that women would be significantly less interested in politics even in a country whose parliament has reached gender parity. This suggests that women's under-representation in political institutions is not sufficient to explain the gender gap in political interest.

### Institutional Factors

Electoral systems could also influence gender differences in political interest. @kittilson2010 find that proportional election systems --- but not federalism and parliamentary systems --- reduce gender gaps in political interest and political discussion compared to plurality systems. Beyond this study, there have not been any academic inquiries into the institutional determinants of the political interest gender gap. Moreover, this distinction does not address the root cause of the gender gap in political interest.

### Individual Factors

#### Life-cycle events

Life-cycle events, including motherhood and employment, might also contribute to gender differences in political interest. First, parenthood might weaken political interest, especially for women. In a British study, @campbellrosie2008 find that being a mother has a negative effect on political interest similar in size to being a father. However, women are more likely than men to report lacking time to keep up with politics due to family time pressures. Moreover, studies in the United States, Denmark, and Finland have found that the birth of a first child reduces political discussion and political participation more among women than men, especially in the short run, since housework duties and child-rearing are disproportionately handled by women [@bhatti2019; @gidengil2008]. These findings might also translate to political interest. Nevertheless, while earlier Canadian studies also found that childbirth was negatively related to political participation [@kay1987], more recent Canadian studies do not find a link between childbirth, political discussion, and political participation [@gidengil2008; @oneill2017].

Second, labour force participation could have a different impact on political interest for women relative to men, as was commonly hypothesized when women started to enter the labour force [@bashevkin1993]. This theory suggests that women's lack of integration in the labour market explains why they are less politically interested. @schlozman1999 explain the rationale as follows: "exposure on the job to a broader array of people and issues would heighten engagement with politics \[including political interest\], especially among \[United States\] women" (44). However, both @schlozman1999 and @jennings1981 fail to find strong effects of labour force participation on the gender gap in political interest in the United States.

@mestre2012 also find that women work on average three more hours of paid and unpaid work than men and that the amount of unpaid domestic work is negatively related to political interest for women, suggesting women's lower political interest could stem from a lack of time. However, the same study also finds that the amount of unpaid domestic work is unrelated to political interest for men, which means some other factors must be at play to explain gender differences.^[On the related questions of education and social class, @verba1997 find that these variables cannot explain the gender gap in self-reported political interest.]

#### Biology

The impact of biology, and more specifically genetics, on general political interest, has been confirmed by recent studies on twins. @klemmensen2012 find that political interest and political efficacy are heritable and come from the same underlying genetic factor. The heritability of political interest, i.e. the proportion of the variability in political interest due to genetic differences among a population, varies in important ways from one study to the other and one national context to the other. It has been estimated that heritability stands at 24% (@weinschenk2017, United States), 36% (@weinschenk2017, Minnesota), 40% (@arceneaux2012, United States), 43% (@klemmensen2012, United States), 48% (@vanditmars2023, Germany), 50% (@dawes2014, Sweden and @weinschenk2019, Germany), 57% (@klemmensen2012, Denmark), and 62% (@bell2009, Canada and the United States). Canada therefore seems to be a country in which genetics explain a lot of the variation in political interest.

One of these studies, @vanditmars2023, assesses heritability by sex of the child, with estimates of 21.9--50.8% for girls and women and 39.6--57.2% for boys and men. Despite these differences not being statistically significant, they find that the heritability of political interest remains stable for men across age groups on average, women's political interest becomes more heritable and less a function of the shared environment in which they live as they age. They attribute this result to the fact that when they reach adulthood, "women can more easily select into environments in which they can pursue their predisposition that drives interest in politics, which is supported by our indications of larger heritability estimates for twins who moved out of the parental home" (11). Given the large confidence intervals of the estimates, these results need to be interpreted with caution. Studies have not studied the question of whether mothers or fathers are more likely to genetically transmit interest in politics.

All these studies emphasize that genetic differences, when they are found, add to but do not replace differences in political socialization. While estimates vary between samples, these numbers imply that 38 to 76% of the variability in political interest within these populations likely comes from environmental factors. A recent study also finds that "family socialization can compensate for (genetic) individual differences and foster increased political engagement," including political interest [@rasmussen2021, 1]. Genetics can also interact with environmental factors such as socialization [@vanditmars2023].

#### Socialization

Overall, structural, institutional, life-cycle, and biological factors provide a partial explanation of the gender gap in political interest, but socialization seems to be an especially fruitful avenue, as biological studies themselves admit. @hooghe2022 defines political socialization as "the process where individual actors acquire political attitudes as a result of outside influences from their direct environment" (99).

The idea that gender differences in political interest are rooted in early childhood socialization has been argued by many for a long time [@bashevkin1993; @fraile2017]. @mayer2004 find that political interest is slightly higher for boys than girls in grades 7--9 in China, Mexico, and the United States, but not in Japan. @bos2022 find that girls are slightly more interested in politics at 6--7 years old, but then boys become more interested, and the gap grows larger until early adolescence.

Moreover, international and longitudinal studies find that political interest remains remarkably stable throughout life, including for high-school students, whose political interest is already high [@fraile2020; @neundorf2013; @prior2010; @prior2019]. Still, studies suggest that political interest becomes stronger from adolescence through early adult life [@neundorf2013], and even more so for men [@jennings1981, 276]. Political socialization continues at the adult age --- but it does so at a lower rate than among children and teenagers, which are therefore at the center of this dissertation.

Socialization can be carried out by multiple actors. Studies have identified four agents of socialization who play a key role in transmitting or influencing children's political interest: parents [@dostiegoulet2009en; @mayer2004; @neundorf2013; @shehata2019], peers [@klofstad2007; @shehata2019; @huckfeldt1995], media [@holt2013; @lupia2005; @shehata2019], and schools [@dassonneville2012; @maheo2019; @neundorf2016]. These agents can also influence each other, with @shehata2019 finding that political news consumption by parents and peers can influence parents and peers' political interest and, eventually, their children's. Transmission by parents and peers can take the form of interactions, notably political discussions. For their part, media and schools can be agents of socialization through the contents they produce --- notably political news or citizenship education classes --- or through the agents that present these contents --- journalists, teachers, or influencers.

The relative importance of these four agents has been studied by many. In Quebec, @dostiegoulet2009en finds that 14- to 17-year-old teenagers' political interest is better predicted by the frequency of political discussions with their parents than with friends, while discussions with history class teachers have a significant but lesser influence on children's political interest. In Sweden, @shehata2019 finds that 13- to 18-year-old teenagers' political interest is mostly affected by their parents' political interest, with peers also having an important influence but no long-lasting effects. In Germany, @oswald1998 find that political discussions and information-getting among 16-to-18--year-olds come mainly from schools and media, followed by parents and friends. In Finland, @koskimaa2015 find that 16- to 18-year-olds' political interest is more successfully predicted by the presence of politics in their family and among their friends, with friends being the most important predictor, contrary to Dostie-Goulet's [-@dostiegoulet2009en] and Shehata and Amnå's [-@shehata2019] results. The influence of school is marginally statistically significant in that study. Finally, @jennings1981 and @neundorf2013 find that parents' role in political interest transmission mostly occurs during teenage years, while other factors explain growth among adults.

To summarize, gender differences already appear at a young age; one of the main mechanisms that allow for its development is socialization; and the four main agents of socialization are parents, peers, media and schools. Among these influences, parents and peers seem to be the most important ones. Yet, what remains to be established is *how* socialization results in girls reporting less interest in politics than boys. In practice, two main theories may help explain the gendered influence of these four agents in transmitting political interest to children: *social learning theory* and *gender homophily theory*. Both theories point to a broad influence of same-gender role models in socialization.

##### Social learning theory

It is not a coincidence that daughters and sons of famous politicians often become politicians themselves, as studies of family political dynasties have found [@geys2017]. In Canada, in recent memory, one can think of Justin Trudeau, Caroline Mulroney, Preston Manning or Ches Crosbie, who were all sons and daughters of prominent politicians and themselves rose to different levels within the political sphere. *Social learning theory* suggests that children learn through the observation of their parents and peers, and model their behaviour, attitudes, habits and values after them [@gidengil2016b; @shehata2019]. Through this process of observation of others, "children gradually learn what is considered appropriate and socially rewarded, and what is not in different contexts" [@shehata2019, 1058]. Transmission of political attitudes is deemed to be more effective when cue-giving and reinforcement from the socializing agent are strong and consistent [@jennings2009; @prior2019].

While research about social learning and politics has most often been applied to the transmission of political participation [@gidengil2016b] or political engagement more generally [@jennings1981], a few recent studies argue social learning can also apply to orientations such as interest --- in this case, political interest. @prior2019 argues social learning can explain the transmission of political interest from parents to children. He suggests this transmission process can only occur at a time when children still live in the family home and after they start acquiring an understanding of what politics is --- that is, in their early teens. @shehata2019 also hypothesize that parents and peers who value current news affairs knowledge can transmit their political interest to children through both learning opportunities and social pressure. Learning opportunities can occur through political discussions between children and their parents or peers, or through children's exposition to their parents watching or reading the news daily, which can give them a more concrete understanding of how politics affects their lives, a factor that predicts the development of political interest. Social pressure can occur when children feel they need to take an interest in politics to develop a sense of belonging or social identity. If a child taking an interest in politics is socially rewarded through parental or peer attention, they will start associating political interest with positive feelings. @jennings2009 also highlight parents' important role in fostering higher political engagement --- including political interest --- among their children, linking that role to a social learning process.

Social learning theory therefore explains why children of interested parents would be more interested in politics, but what does it say about gender differences in interest? Research has found that social learning exhibits gender effects: *observer--model similarity* leads children to model their behaviour, values and attitudes based on the behaviour, values and attitudes of models that resemble them [@bandura1969]. Since political interest is one such attitude, it follows that social learning can produce gender differences in political interest. Indeed, past research has shown that the trickle-down effect of political engagement from parents to children works in gendered ways, with sons modeling their behaviour after their fathers and daughters after their mothers [@gidengil2016b].^[This dissertation uses the words "mother" and "father" without implying that there is exactly one mother and one father per family. Other situations are very common.] Political interest is also more strongly correlated between mothers and daughters and between fathers and sons than any other combination [@beauregard2008; @neundorf2013; @owen1988].

##### Gender homophily theory

With regards to political interest transmission by friends, another mechanism is worth uncovering: the one that encourages children to stick with --- and discuss with --- same-gender peers. As a general term, *homophily* is "the principle that a contact between similar people occurs at a higher rate than among dissimilar people" [@mcpherson2001, 416]. More specifically, *gender homophily* refers to how children of the same gender tend to stick together and become friends, from at least the beginning of primary school [@stehle2013]. Children are even more likely to drop friends who have a friend from the other gender than to add the other-gender friend to their own group of friends [@mcpherson2001]. These patterns increase during primary school but diminish --- without disappearing --- after puberty [@shrum1988; @stehle2013].

Studies about gender homophily in social networking websites among teenagers and adults have yielded more nuanced results. @thelwall2009 finds that MySpace users aged 16 and over have similar levels of interactions regardless of their gender. However, @laniado2016 find strong gender homophily among adolescent girls and boys aged 14 to 19 --- though not always for the same kinds of online activities --- on a Spanish social networking service. Overall, evidence suggests that gender homophily among children and young adolescents encourages them to discuss mainly with children of the same gender and that this may also translate to social networks.

After assessing the importance of structural, institutional and individual factors on the gender gap in political interest, it seems like one individual factor plays a particularly prominent role which has already been well theorized: socialization. Yet, this theorization would be incomplete without addressing measurement issues with typical single-item measures of political interest, which is the focus of the next section.

## Political Interest Dissected: Interest in Different Political Topics

Perhaps as a result of social learning processes, research has found that men and women are often interested in different issues. It is therefore possible that women are more interested in aspects of politics that they do not always see as political. This issue and other concerns about the existence of a gender gap in political interest have led some studies to suggest that the typically reported gender gap in political interest might be the result of inadequate measurement [@alozie2003; @bourque1974; @keeling2023; @tormos2022]. While @alozie2003 use a very broad concept of "political orientation" including discussion, attention, and participation in various activities, recent studies have found a creative way of addressing the limitations of the traditional measure of political interest --- asking respondents about their interests in several political issues instead of asking them a single question. On average, women report more interest in topics such as health care, education and gender issues, while men report more interest in foreign policy, partisan politics, and law and order, and topics such as taxes and local politics seem to be equally interesting to men and women [@campbellrosie2008; @coffe2013; @ferrin2020; @hayes1993; @kuhn2004; @sabella2004; @tormos2022; @verba1997]. These studies generally conclude that men and women are simply interested in different domains of politics and that politics is mentally associated with elections and parties, topics in which men have more interest.^[This mental association might be culture-specific to some degree. Conceptions of politics could be more removed from partisan politics in other situations such as Northwest Territories' and Nunavut's non-partisan legislative assemblies, but also in authoritarian one-party regimes.] Because of the association between politics and partisan issues, and women's lower interest in partisan issues, women report lower levels of political interest overall. This claim is more than simply hypothetical or correlational, as @tormos2022 find causal evidence to support it. Their findings show that prompting for interest in several topics for which women typically report more interest, including gender issues and health care, makes women and men rate their political interest similarly, with an increase in political interest that is stronger among women than among men. Conversely, prompting respondents for partisan politics slightly reduces political interest among both men and women, but more strongly among women. @keeling2023 uses a similar research design and also finds that prompting for interest in several topics including gender issues reduces the gender gap in self-reported political interest, although this decline is due to a decline in self-reported political interest among men rather than an increase among women.^[Among institutional and structural mentioned in the previous section, it is unclear whether these factors explain the gender gap in partisan political interest only, or interest in several political topics too.]

Why would women be more interested in health care, education and gender issues specifically? @kuhn2004 argues that women's "political thinking revolves around terms of compassion and cooperation, not around contest and competition. Females are interested in solving concrete problems and are driven by social empathy, egalitarian values, and engagement for other people. \[...\] Females prefer unconventional forms of political participation" (96). Women's higher interest in gender issues such as abortion and gender-based violence can be explained by the fact that these issues are more likely to affect them directly [@ferrin2020]. For similar reasons, @campbellrosie2008 suggest that women's higher interest in health services matches with statistics suggesting that women are more frequent users of these services compared to men. Moreover, women's "continuing disproportionate share of childcare responsibilities may also lead them to be more interested in issues relating to education and social services" (64). @stolle2010 also find that women give better answers than men to knowledge questions about the health care system, and scholars have found strong links between political interest and political knowledge --- the former often predicting the latter [@elo2010; @pettey1988; @prior2019].

Why would men be more interested in foreign policy, partisan politics, and law and order? The competitive nature of partisan politics seems to tap into men's tendency towards agency, leading them to express more interest in that aspect of politics. For instance, @campbellrosie2008 show that men's higher self-reported political interest derives from the fact that they are more *agentic*, i.e., focused on self-assertion, including competition, while women are more *communal*, i.e., focused on cooperation.^[Tendencies towards agency and communion might be the result of biological or environmental factors, and may be reinforced by societal expectations about men's and women's roles and socialization more generally.] While studies are unclear about why men report more interest in foreign policy and law and order, it is possible to argue that men's higher rates of incarceration [@wpb2024a; @wpb2024b], stronger presence in the police force [@statcan2024; @vanewijk2012], and overrepresentation among world leaders [@ipu2024] could lead them to take more interest in these areas. @stolle2010 also find men give better answers than women to knowledge questions about partisan politics.

The reasonings behind differences in interest for different topics often center around a dichotomy between competition and cooperation --- men tend to be more interested in competition-focused politics, while women tend to be interested in cooperation-focused politics. The next section links together studies about gendered political interests and studies about gendered socialization to create the dissertation's theoretical framework.

## Hypotheses: Towards a Unified Socialization Theory

This dissertation asks *"What are the differences in political interests between men and women, how do they get reproduced over time, and why?"* I hypothesize that political socialization plays a central role in explaining the emergence of gender differences in interest in political interest, with parents and peers the most important agents of childhood political socialization, in particular during the teenage years. Furthermore, I argue that gender differences are more about the type of political interest rather than the level of political interest. My perspective is not historical, and I do not examine how the first gender differences in political interest may have occurred --- I instead focus on how these differences get reproduced in the twenty-first century.

A broad application of socialization theories that includes parents and peers would provide a more comprehensive understanding of who influences girls and boys in how much interest they have in various aspects of politics. Gender homophily and social learning both suggest that children are influenced by same-gender role models, but these theories need to be further specified. Social learning theory and observer--model similarity would predict that a parent's political interest influences the development of their children's political interest more strongly for their same-gender children than other-gender children, but whether this applies to interest in political topics other than partisan politics has not been tested. On the other hand, gender homophily predicts more same-gender than mixed-gender peer discussions, and this finding applies to political discussions as well, especially early in children's lives. However, no study has thus far examined the implications of this theory for gender differences in political interest. I break new ground by measuring interest in various political topics and linking these interests to discussions with parents and peers about these same topics, something no previous research has attempted. Parents' and children's political interest is typically compared using a single measure of political interest, but we do not know if same-gender role models have the same impact on interest transmission for each political topic.

***Hypothesis 1**: Adolescence is the moment in time when gender differences in political interests emerge.*

***Hypothesis 2**: Children's political interests are more affected by political discussions with their same-gender parent(s) than other-gender parent(s).*

***Hypothesis 3**: Children's political interests are more affected by political discussions with their same-gender peers than other-gender peers.*

All three hypotheses use the term "political interests" to refer to "interests in different political topics". According to Hypothesis 2, on average, a mother will have more transmission potential of her political interests to her daughters than sons through political discussion, for example. Hypothesis 3 uses the same logic for same-gender peers. All three hypotheses are divided into several sub-hypotheses to measure as many of their implications as possible in @sec-chap3, @sec-chap4 and @sec-chap5, respectively. The gendered influences of media and schools are discussed in the conclusion but are not the subject of specific hypotheses or chapters since studies have generally found parents and peers play a bigger role. The general theory is that *children's political interests come mainly from socialization by their same-gender parent(s) and peers*.

@fig-hypotheses summarizes the dissertation's theoretical framework in a simplified way. On the left-hand side of the figure, the central variable of interest is "Political topics girls are interested in". While these topics can be quite varied, the legend specifies that they should disproportionately --- compared to men --- include health care, education, and gender issues, represented by the red color. As girls age and become mothers, their interests in these topics are expected to remain mostly similar, as represented by the arrow pointing to "Political topics mothers are interested in". The causal chain leads mothers who are interested in a specific political topic to discuss this topic with their daughters, especially adolescent daughters. "Political discussion between mothers and girls" then sparks girls' interest in that topic, leading the arrow back to "Political topics girls are interested in". Finally, a feedback loop leads girls to discuss the political topics they are interested in in girls' peer groups, while other topics discussed in these peer groups also influence their own interests.

The right-hand side of @fig-hypotheses shows the same processes happening with boys, fathers, and boys' peer groups, represented by the blue color. However, the topics boys are more likely to be interested in are different --- partisan politics, law and crime, and international affairs. Interest in partisan politics, displayed in purple, can then lead to a higher desire to get involved in partisan politics --- political ambition. Higher political ambition, finally, can lead to higher legislative representation. In this framework, boys' and men's higher interest in partisan politics is viewed as a contributing factor to their over-representation in Canadian political institutions. A dividing line separates the left-hand side and right-hand side of the figure. This dividing line indicates that transmission largely happens between people of the same gender as a result of gender homophily --- the tendency to stick with same-gender people.

## Organization of the Dissertation

This dissertation mostly relies on survey data collected among Canadian children and teenagers. @sec-chap2 outlines the data and methods used in the empirical chapters of this dissertation. It also provides descriptive statistics about some of the main variables used in the data analysis, including gender, discussions with role models, interest in five political topics, and socio-demographic variables.

The next four chapters are empirical. @sec-chap3 studies the evolution of political interest through life, answering Hypothesis 1 as well as questions about the stability of self-reported political interest. @sec-chap4 explores the role of parents in the transmission of political interest and provides the answer to Hypothesis 2. @sec-chap5 does the same for the role of peers, answering Hypothesis 3. Finally, @sec-chap6 provides an overall assessment of the influence of role models on the development of political interest among children and teenagers, and of the extent to which socialization can explain political interest gender gaps. The overarching goals of this dissertation are to provide a better understanding of how men and women view politics differently, to raise awareness about this discrepancy and to provide recommendations for actors who seek to encourage interest in some --- or many --- political topics among adult citizens and future adult citizens of both genders.
